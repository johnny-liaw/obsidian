# Symmetrics vs Asymmetric Encryption
#### Symmetric
 - Using the same key to encrypt and decrypt.
 - Only one key exists

#### Asymmetric
-  A key pair, private and public key.
-  If encrypted using the public key, only the private key can decrypt.
-  If encrypted uisng the private key, only the public key can decrypt.
- Also known as 'trap door functions'.

# Digital signatures
> ‚≠ê A digital signature legitimizes a transaction. Each transaction would have a unique signature.
- Each signature uniquely identified a transaction, else you could swap signature between transactions and compromise legitimacy.
