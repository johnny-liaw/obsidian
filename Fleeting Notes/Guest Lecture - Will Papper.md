# History of DAOs
Between 2017 -> 2020 several things came out:
- Gnosis: allows for management of DAOs as a community
- Moloch: on chain governance protocol, allows for proposals to be submitted?

- compound DAO vs moloch DAO

- DAO onboarding
- DAO coordination / project management
- Index coop for developing protocols
- Olympus dao is quite accessible.

- There's a community direction and protocol direction for DAOs, what?
