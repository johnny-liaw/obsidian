# Intro to Blockchain & Smart Contracts
## Ethereum Keypairs
- The public key is typically 64 bytes long.
- The address of a wallet is the last 20 bytes (last 40 hex chars) of the public key [^1].
- The private key is 32 bytes long.

> üí° During research I came across EAOs (externally owned accounts) and _contract accounts_. The above are for EOAs.

## EOA vs Contract Accounts
There are 2 main types of accounts in Ethereum:
- Contract accounts AND
- Externally owned accounts

Externally Owned Accounts:
- Can send/receive either
- Controleld by private key.
- Has no code logic associated with it.

Contract accounts:
- Has data that is public for anyone to see.
- Can send/receive ether.
- Has code logic associated with it that is public.
	- Code execution is triggered by transactions or message calls from other contracts.

> üí° There are a 4 main types of message calls in Ethereum. Contract to contract communication is specifically ==DELEGATECALL==.[^3]

## Turing completeness
- A concept that describes a programming language's ability to perform tasks.
- If the program can complete tasks ran by the ==universal turing machine==, then it is considered _turing complete_.

## Smart contract usecase:
- Decentrlized Finance (DeFi)
- Non fungible tokens (NFTs)
- Auctions
- Elections
- Trading
- Resource sharing
- Donations.
- Multiparty decision making

## Ethereum Computation Requirements
The point of blockchain is that it is fair, verifiable and ==deterministic==. In order for that to happen every node must produce the same result given the same resutls. (A very functional nature at that). As such blockchain computations have the following requirements:
- No network requests
	- The blockchain itself should have everything it needs to verify it self.
	- > üí° Gathering off chain data and pasting in the chain is called working with an ==oracle==[^4]
- No randomness
- No asynchronicity
	- ‚ùì I haven't figured this out yet #Questions/Blockchain
- No node specific logic (timezone, Ip addr, etc).

## How are contracts executed
- A contract is executed by every node attempting to mine a block containing the transaction to that contract.
	- ‚ùì So do transacteions only exist on specific blocks?
	- How many nodes are there mining a block?
		- What if 50% of the nodes mining a block illegitimize and illegitimate transaction? #Questions/Blockchain
