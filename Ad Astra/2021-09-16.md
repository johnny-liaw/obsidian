# Web3
- Today was an absolute struggle town.
- Wrote up a new contract with additional fn's such as `getAllWave`.
- Kept getting an `invalid address` error and turns out I needed to deplopy it to the rinkeby network which I didn't.
- Got a function going retrieving the number of waves on click of a button
- Got some other helper functions going i.e. initialising the contract as a state when the wallet is connected, and so forth.
