- Completed the course!
- Worked out how to rng in a smart contract.
- Used a mapping for the first time.
- Studied a bit of the open pallete contract, turns out it's got public functions that take the token ID to generate the RGB values. Which is really interesting, because these are gonna be `pure` functions and thus cost nothing to run.
