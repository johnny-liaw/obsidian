# Web3
Today I decided to try and restart my web3 experience. There is little emphasis on the results, but more emphasis on the experience and the journey itself.

I was working on the buildspace create your own mini turn based NFT browser game project. And I got my first contract deployed (again) !

Also learnt a few things abour Harhdat, in particular the hre object that is injected when `npx hardhat`  is ran.
