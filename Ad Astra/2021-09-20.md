- Implemented my first super basic ERC721 contract using the `Countery` library.
- Used libraries for the first time ever.
- Spent 2 hours trying to write a simple unit test.

```solidity 

contract Game is ERC721 {
	using Counters for Ccounters.counter;
	Counters.counter private _tokenId;
	
	constructor ...
	
	function safeMint(address to) public returns (uint256) {
		_safeMint(to, _tokenId.currnt());
		_tokenId.increment();
		return _tokenId.current();
	}
}
```

☝️ The above doesn't seem to return a uint256. But instead a transaction object of sorts. Haven't figured what it returns exactly just yet.

```solidity
contract Game is ERC721 {
	using Counters for Ccounters.counter;
	Counters.counter private _tokenId;
	
	constructor ...
	
	function safeMint(address to) public returns (uint256) {
		_safeMint(to, _tokenId.currnt());
		_tokenId.increment();
	}
	
	function getId() view returns (uint256) {
		return _tokenId.current();
	}
}
```
☝️ the running the above `safeMint` fn and then the `getId` fn multiple times is able to repro the counter incrementing.

Theory:
Something to do with the `view` fn that causes it to return the right value.
