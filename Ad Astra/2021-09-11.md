- Got local dev env working, able to import openzeppelin contracts.
- Learnt about the `_safeMint` function in `ERC721`.
- Learnt that `truffle migrate` also performs `truffle compile` if there are changes to the contract.
	- `truffle migrate --reset` runs all migrations from the start, which is unnecessary for local dev and especially unnecessary for mainnet dev.
