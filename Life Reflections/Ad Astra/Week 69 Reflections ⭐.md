### A tough week

Honestly the previous days she’d been pretty emotional as well. On Wednesday I just felt so low and on the outside, I confided and she said it was going to be okay. . She cried when I told her I needed time and wouldn’t be going to her cousin’s basketball game. And on Thursday she offered to come sit with me. What I didn’t know at the time was that she had to work extra hours after work, and said that’s what love is, you show up even when it’s inconvenient. I felt a bit sad looking back at that, it felt like a very subtle jab that I wasn’t loving her, even though I’m dealing with a bunch of things.

### Saturday, 3 months

Earlier in the week, I thought I was doing fine. But there was a meeting with Tim Jones and afterards I just felt super tense. After spending a lot of time supervising Feier, I just felt so drained. Like there’s nothing left in me.

Really thankfully, Avy cancelled cus she’s sick. That was just a blessing in disguise. So Sachini and I decided to spend the day together for our 3 month anniverary. It initially started out good, and I tried my best. But after lunch I said I’m not feeling too well, and would like some time to rest before meeting out with her later at church and after. And she started crying. So I spent the next 2 hours consoling her, cus she felt like I only wanted to be with her when it’s convenient. Honestly the previous days she’d been pretty emotional as well. On Wednesday I just felt so low and on the outside, I confided and she said it was going to be okay. . She cried when I told her I needed time and wouldn’t be going to her cousin’s basketball game. So I sat in the car with her for two hours consoling her. it was quite emotional for me too.

She said things like, it makes me insecure that for our future. That what i say are just words and it’s actions that mean the most. She wouldn’t even let me hug and hold her when all that was happening. I was already feeling off, but in hindsight what little I had, I gave it entirely to her. I prayed and prayed and prayed over us, I just felt so helpless. I tried to cancel all the words said over us. i admitted to her that I feel like I’m failing her. She immediatley grabbed me and said she’s sorry for saying those things, those were lies.

During the day, she also said how my unkeenness for Paulynn’s double date also made her sad. I’ll let her convict me if I’ve said anything I shouldn’t have said.

At night before she went to sleep, I prayed for her and sent her a voice note. letting her know her identity is in God, it’s not in how good of a partner she is. Tbh I needed this for myself too, I was running on fumes.

### Sunday, doubts

I woke at 4am, and felt like God was telling me to rest. And I was feeling very low. In the morning when i woke up i sent her that voice note.

Afterwards, dad told me if i wanted to go through the building inspector report and go on site to figure it out. I was already feeling quite iffy and when I heard that I just wasn’t feeling it. But said yes cus I wanted to please dad. But as I spent the next hour reading and understanding it, I just felt such a weight on me that I couldn’t shift. And I didn’t have it in me to carry it either. The work situation, the relationship situation, now this. I just couldn’t carry it. I don’t usually admit to dad that I’m not doing well, but I had to this time. I think he tried his best but his answer wasn’t the most encouraging.

I went an a 35 min walk to help myself feel better. And on the walk I was just looking down the whole time cus I felt so heavy. I felt the crushing weight of expectation. That I was not able to be there for my relationship to smoothen out the rifts, I just had to let it be. That there are these catchups coming up and i was worried about them, what if I couldn’t do it. My head felt tight again, so many different things. Not being able to be there for dad and help him with the house. I just felt the weight of so many expectations that i can’t meet. I opened Grace’s message again and she said “do not be surprised if there is tension is your relationship”. What a foreshadowing despite not being told much details.

I’m just crying out to God, asking for him to intercede. God I can’t relief the tension in this relationship, I’ll leave it to you to do that.

I remember the times when even making a phone call was overwhelming. It felt like at times I was sluggish physically and living outside my body

Yesterday she admitted to me that she’s been feeling like I only love her when it’s convenient for about 2-3 weeks. I just feel so sad when i hear that.

### Sunday talk with Mom

Probably one of the smarter things I did today was messaged mom and told her that I was feeling overwhelmed today. She came home early after serving at church, and we went out to get my salofalk refill and had a nice talk at maccas.

I told mom everything, about the potential LG, about the dreams, the spiritual battles, the really tough week, what happened on Saturday with Sachini, this morning with Darbecca. And right now I feel a bit better. I think a few things are clear:

1. Sachini and I have to understand each other better. She needs to know what I went through in 2024, and that when I need space, I really need time. We need a way to communicate to each other how we’re feeling, similar like how hospitals do when something happens.
2. When you lead a LG, there’s a duty of care. What happens when one of us goes down, how would we adapt/work together to keep the LG going. When one of us goes down, one of us would have to shoulder more.
3. I would like to understand what triggers Sachini’s reaction to me needing to take time for myself. Mom mentioned it’s something that she might need prayer for.

  

I told mom that sometimes when I get like this, I doubt myself. Whether I’m capable in a relationship. She said to never doubt myself. She said you’re going to be an amazing father and an amazing husband. She said I’m so creative, I’m so capable. And I was sort of tearing up in Maccas cus I never heard her say those words before, and she was too. I felt very encouraged by that.
