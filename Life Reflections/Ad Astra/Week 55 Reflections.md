### graces message

After I told Sandra that it may have been a yes but not yet from god, I told grace too, the following is her response.

> Well done in praying fervently and really asking God about this Johnny. Thank you for sharing your personal journey with me.
> 
> As I prayed for you and Sachini just now after reading your message, I confirmed that God said ‚Äúyes, but not yet‚Äù.
> 
> I have the feeling it‚Äôs now more on Sachini‚Äôs part. Remember that in any partnership, it takes two to tango, both party needs to be in agreement.
> 
> There‚Äôs nothing else that you can do but keep praying now, as you wait for the Lord to heal Sachini‚Äôs heart more and for her to fall in love with Jesus again before falling in love with you.
> 
> This is a wonderful news Johnny! It means that you are way ahead in your journey to healing!
> 
> It‚Äôs very wise of you to continue trusting the Lord for His perfect timing and not to expect anything with Sachini, besides leading a LG with her.  
> The Lord is giving you more faith and He is entrusting you with greater things (young people to lead, protect and guide) as you have steward well the little things given by Him.  
> 
> The spaciousness that you feel in your heart is a sign of healing as you surrender your needs and desires unto the Lord. It‚Äôs also a sign that He is enlarging your tent and you‚Äôre ready to receive more from God.
> 
> I‚Äô so privileged to witness your transformation Johnny. I truly praise God for who you have become üôè
>

> I was reading something on the life of William Carey (the missionary to India) the other week and noted that it was a sermon on Isaiah 54:2-3 which gave him his life‚Äôs mission. The passage reads:
> 
> ‚ÄúEnlarge the place of your tent, stretch your tent curtains wide, do not hold back; lengthen your cords, strengthen your stakes. For you will spread out to the right and to the left; your descendants will dispossess nations and settle in their desolate cities.‚Äù
> 
> In 1792, when Carey preached on this verse, the title of his message was: ‚ÄúExpect Great Things from God; Attempt Great things for God‚Äù.
> 
> Looking at this verse, it occurs to me that ‚ÄúEnlargement‚Äù is an encouragement to think big, dream big and get a bigger perspective.
> 
> When a black dot is put on a screen, this always becomes the focus, rather than the big white screen. We need to make God bigger, not the small issues of life. God is bigger than opposition, crisis, disappointment, health, financial problems, or whatever it is you‚Äôre dealing with.
> 
> In what do we place our hope? ‚ÄúStretching‚Äù involves getting past our current limits (‚ÄúI press on‚Ä¶‚Äù says Paul), which operates like making a muscle stronger.
> 
> ‚ÄúDo not hold back‚Äù involves overcoming fear. There are times when we need to do things that make us afraid, and break the hold it has over us.
> 
> ‚ÄúLengthen‚Äù is to go further in output and effort. Going the extra mile is extra, not normal.
> 
> ‚ÄúStrengthen‚Äù involves the development of character, which enables us to deal with the things that come. If we are not strong on the inside, we will be moved from our path when trials come.

when I read that, I felt like I had a moment of elation. But then I spent the rest of the day catching myself having fantasies of sachini and not allowing myself to go there. I spent a lot f my day fighting myself. And I feel a part of me just isn‚Äôt willing to accept this from God. I spoke to Sandra later and she feels grace is right. And that scares me even more because this could be true, and it‚Äôs quite the roller coaster.

More than ever this is a time to consecrate myself, I will be praying for the following things:

- to accept gods love if this is from him. For him to breakdown the walls in my heart
- Learn how to lean on God more and find joy in it
- Fall more in love with god before sharing that same love for another human

### a time of confusion

I went through a time of confusion where in my mind I just kept toying and toying and trying to think about the whole Sachini situation, how I'm gonna approach it, what's gonna happen when she shows up in front of me, etc, etc. And I went through this giant confusion crisis that lasted most of the night. And later on the next day I realized that I'm not supposed to work this out on my own. And God has me. And I don't need to be the one to work it out. All I need to do is surrender.

### self consecrating

After that I realized that I needed to spend time with God, so I've been making it super intentional to spend an hour reading and then afterwards 30 minutes reading the Bible and getting close to God. And I feel like I was able to be a lot more at peace and I even feel like I was able to surrender more of it. But it turns out I think I ended up surrendering a bit too much, where I also suppressed how I felt.

### Rachel

Sandra was right. I should have just not fight this battle because I had so much on my plate at the time with the confusion, everything going out with Sachini. Lessons learned.

### Kids church

First time doing kids church, I was honestly super scared before. But ended up being a great experience. By God‚Äôs grace i was put on the year 4 girls‚Äô table. Im leaning towards continuing but right now with the fog of confusion around Sachini it‚Äôs really hard to gain clarity and see what God is doing.

### sachini

Another 7 hour day spent together. Started off at Jalan Alor, then Augustus icecream, then lookout where we just laid there for 2 hours. Then maccas, where I successfully navigated back to her place, and then booking to see a play on Thursday. Her favorite flower combo is white and yellow.
