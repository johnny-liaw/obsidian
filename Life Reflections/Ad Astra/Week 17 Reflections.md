I think it was an alright week, it was a 4 day work week so the days went by quick. I enjoyed the weeks where I have LG and then church. For the first time in _a long while_ though, I had something on a Friday, so 3 social events this week.

We watched inside out 2, and honestly the part about anxiety was really relatable to me. Afterwards there was some slight shotness but mostly gone the next morning when I woke up. The following day’s church + dinner + desert was great as I got to see Kendrick + Chris.

After spotting them to my right while during church service, I felt a surge of fear come through me. I didn’t want to be there as I was insecure about my energy levels and whether I’d be able to keep up. But the worst didn’t remotely happen and I kept my energy really chill while still maintaining some conversation.

What stood out to me this week was I felt I had a vision/lightbulb moment of sorts where I smashed out all the milestone approach to life, and just allowed myself to feel the happiness where I am. And I prayed to God to help me surrender that way of living, as it was harming me.

Several ways my milestone based approach harms me:

- I’ll be okay when I feel a certain way
- When my recovery has reached a certain point
- Constantly searching for a different way of life than that I already have.

  

I also started praying for a good group of Christian friends, friends that help me deepen my relationship with God and ground me in his spirit. I will continue praying for this, maybe I’ve already been blessed with it.

Overall it was quite a consistent week, onto the next.
