### struggling With god

I feel I’ve just been struggling with god. My dreams have reduced substantially. I just feel passed over from gods blessings and my heart has hardened a fair bit, I find that I’m also ore confused and less willing to see gods work in my life. Grace has been praying and encouraging me a lot lately and that has been amazing. It’s hard to reconcile the fact that he is a loving father and yet I feel passed over for some of these things.

## a weekend full of catchups

I saw Annette on Saturday that was really good and we had a great catchup. I gel with Christian’s so much better. In our viewpoint in our way of living and the activities we chooses to take part in,

for Sunday I just felt very lethargic and emotionally low the whole day. I wasn’t going to not go, but even on the drive there I feel like I just wasn’t sure I knew I could handle a catch up. And turned out to be okay, got better and I got settled in. It’s interesting that after I catch up with Annette I actually felt pretty tired, but today after catching up with Aryan Raymond and yin didn’t really feel the case.
