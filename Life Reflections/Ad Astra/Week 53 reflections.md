|[[Untitled 8]]|Woke up in the middle of the night with a distinct conviction, keep your eyes closed, get ready. And then a wave of fear and terror started washing over me. I can’t remember the last time a spiritual attack was so evident since may/june 2024. Eventually the wave subsided, this was off the back of praying for spiritual sight and the ability to surrender my romantic life to god fully.|February 17, 2025|DD-94|

  
  

### big blow up

All of our patience for grandma was wearing thin. I have been praying for Christian patience, maybe this is it being put to the test. She acts like a queen, but is actually a baby. Is extremely ,y critical, thinks she knows everything, but is incapable of doing anything herself. All of us are at a stage where we just don’t want her to speak.

We were all frustrated with each other after the dropped bowl incident. After which she called me a B*. After that I absolutely wasn’t having it and told her that is completely unacceptable, disrespectful, not on and I expected an apology by the end of the day.

I was honestly fuming. We later had an even bigger blowup at the table, talking about the justified way to speak to each other. “So you want to talk to me about justified ways of speaking to each other, when you’re the one who called me names?l”.

I feel like I definitely poured fuel on the fire, and I apologised first. But I’m not having it , to allow us to descend to the level where that’s the names we call each other.

Father, convict me of any sins that I may have committed, so I may not commit them again. Heal our family lord.

I see the family curse of criticality, when things aren’t done the way we expect we lash out on one another.

### Prayer fatigue

I think I had been praying way too much earlier in the week, and the second half of the week I felt like I was too fatigued to even think about praying. It’s better to be consistent rather than to have a huge output, though I think I really needed it.

from my dreams, it’s clear the enemy is after me for whatever reason, so now is the time to keep investing in my prayer life.

### Walking with the spirit

I think I’m better at walking in the spirit, and recognising when certain things are of the flesh. When I make a move based on things by the flesh it never turns out well. And right now I recognise that my spirit is closed off to Justine and Sachini as well. Not because I don’t like Sachini, but because my spirit recognises the need that gods plan is the one I’m supposed to go with.

### End of trip thoughts

This trip was tough, I struggled massively in the spiritual side with Sachini, and felt like I arrived at a place of clarity. Where I just want to focus on what God has for me and not go off to orchestrate anything on my own. I started praying for spiritual sight and the ability to surrender sachini entirely. I started the week not being able to. And just very confused as to why god gave me that experience but now wants to take it away. I concede I don’t understand it but I trust God to know best and so I surrender it to him, and his peace now covers me.
