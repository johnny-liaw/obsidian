### Renewed Clarity

Sunday night, mom and I had a discussion, and I realize that I feel so much more tense around Sachini than around my family. I thought about this a bit more and realized that I feel I have to strive around her. That it’s not okay to need rest, that I’m always having to put out more than what I had. That I’m constantly choosing between mental health or her. I also don’t feel understood, and for all those reasons I just felt super tense.

### monday

I feel like I woke up with the revelation: you are the Son of God, you have been called into this relationship. Your identity is not in the relationship.

### Sachini

I realize that I get really upset when I disappoint her, or make her upset. I’m constantly doubting whether my feelings are valid and whether I should say what I really think.

Throughout the week, we kept having mini blowups. On the Monday or Tuesday she got upset at me again because I said “I don’t have capacity outside of work”, and she interpreted it as “I don’t have capacity for her”. Honestly that day I thought I was going to faint cus of the burden.

Then something happened later in the week, it felt like we were finally communicating. Whereas before we were saying words. It’s a lot of this is what I feel, these are my needs. We also started to be a lot more open with each other, and more understanding. It really is a different way of talking to each other, it feels like we’re learning how to talk to each other.

On Saturday, we met up with grace to talk about everything that has been going on. She read a love letter from god to me, and that my mind is where they are attacking because they know precisely what god wants to use me for. My spirit , m heart and my leadership, and the enemy is terrified of it. She was also quite prophetic in that she felt there was something with my dad that I needed to address. And she was absolutely right, especially with the dream I had earlier in the week. She says if I don’t at least say my piece, I’ll be carrying this burden for the rest of my life into all the relationships I go into. And maybe I should start by writing a letter to my dad, to start processing it.

She also says that if we look an our partners long enough, we usually identify things about the, we don’t like. But that actually reveals a flaw within ourselves. She said I’m a strategist. I’m really glad she said that because I’m coming to learn about who I am in God.

I mentioned that I sometimes think I just can’t do normal people things because of my condition. She said that’s a big lie. Now she’s cluing me on to these, I can start fighting it. I also mentioned how I feel when I’m down, I feel I can’t be there for the relationship. She immediately called me out on it and said you don’t have to be there for her. She was her own person before and she can take care of yourself, you are your own person and you’ve got to hold that in this relationship. Grace also mentioned that the guilt we feel is also from the enemy.

Sachini and I were talking about it before and I realize I was seeking acceptance from her. She realized she was seeking joy from me. That’s why I’m so attuned to her being upset because I want to be accepted so [much.](http://much.today) Sunday when we hung out it was more chill and I had more energy, I was seeking acceptance less and doing less. Praise Jesus.

Grace also said that Sachini is sent to be the speaker, the microphone. And I’m meant to be the internal person or something? This part I didn’t really understand. I’m supposed to be the inside, and she’s the outside. We are a team.

### Overall

Honestly I’m learning a lot about myself. I love me time, I need it. I don’t want to lead a social life. She gets her energy from people., I don’t. I’m learning that my needs is perfectly acceptable. I’m learning that I don’t need acceptance from people. I learn that I live with this deep wound in my heart, to be accepted. God loves me so much, he is going to give me a choice, like Grace said. A choice whether to do lg or not. I’m learning a lot about what my needs are.
