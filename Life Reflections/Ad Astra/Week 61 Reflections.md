### Struggling with buzzed ness / fatigue

This whole week has been in and out struggling with fatigue and feeling buzzed. A lot of it goes back to Sydney, where you simply weren’t allowed to feel tired. Week after week you are expected to perform and just pull it it of the bag. The stress of expectation. wondering if I’ll ever heal from this.

In general there was a tiredness and restlessness to my soul.

I got the steam deck this week, and after playing brotato for a bit. I felt horrible buzzed. And it was super discouraging and I started doubting everything that I could do once again. Am I gonna be able to do my duties as a husband and a father? Sachini says Gods grace will be there for me, if he has given those things to me.

### Friday date

Spent close to 8 hours together. It was a really long day and I was cooked at the end of it. Having church, cooking, then entertaining then spending time together. I was just cooked after. I also felt a wall between us, idk if it’s just happening in my mind.

### The day after

I felt tired today, and was frustrated because I kept returning to emotional ICU. It was during this day that I realize that I treat down days as a life saving operation, to get better in time for the next thing. **I don’t feel like I enjoy my down time.**

### Resurrection Sunday

Today was a big day, had Vicky’s baptism followed by baptism lunch. And honestly at the baptism lunch I started feeling quite low. But afterwards I revived. Sometimes it’s just a roller coaster to deal with these things.

Later on in the car, Sachini admitted that she feels like I only want to hangout with her in small doses. Because I go off the grid. And don’t invite her into the low moments. She really really wants me not just the good parts. And it hurts her when I don’t invite her in.

She asked me a really good question before, why are you afraid of crashing? Isn’t being tired human? And that really hit me.

  

### Prayers list:

- Show me what you want me to deal with
- Should I go back to therapy?
- Surrender having it together to you, and letting you be the one to provision my day.
- How to bring her into my low moments.
- Teach me how to be okay with conflict
