A thought came to mind today (Monday), I have so much more peace when Iâ€™m not worried about dating life. Whereas before I had no peace. Interesting.

### Holy Spirit convicts

In my conversation with Sandra in Monday night, I realized that I was trying to convince her that maybe God has already put that person in front of her. I then realized, that I'm trying to hard to change her mind. It is the holy Spirit is job to convict. It is also the holy spirit's job to convict a person romantically. This is a mice and I can adopt more of.

### Conviction for Adams wisdom

I forgot when this happened but there was a day where I felt so convicted about Adams wisdom. In the fact of how much I won't need it anymore. And I realize a little part of me has been hanging on to it. I serve a god that demands absolute commitment.

When God took Lot out of Sodom, he says do not look back. When God took the Israelites into the promised land, he gave them a bunch of instructions not to fall back into sin. And only gave them the full promise when they were strong enough.

Felt like I was looking back, and that can't happen anymore. So I deleted everything I had on Adam.

### The dating dreams

I feel it could be my soulish desires, I do find myself getting distracted by girls when I go out. Perhaps more than usual. I feel kind of annoyed at it actually, it feels like a weight/desire that takes away more than it's supposed to give. Lord, what do I do with this?

Like the moment I walk past a beautiful girl, something in me moves really strongly.

  

  

### Preempting your faults

I had a thought after watching the wicked movie on Sunday that I preempt try and fix my issues. I'm super critical in pruning myself. Its God's job to show me what areas I need to work on. Not to trust my own abilities to discern what is and isn't good/bad.

### Unanswered prayers

I have many unanswered prayers, and it makes my heart sore:

- Full restoration
- Partner
- To relate to women the way he wants me to
- Make me the man he intended me to become
