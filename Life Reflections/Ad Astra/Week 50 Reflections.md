### viv & sachini speaking truth into me

It started off as just church, then we went to dinner and then desert after. And this is where things start to get interesting.

Viv starts saying I should come to the future leaders meeting. And she says I have potential, and she really believes it. Basically Raquelle spoke to viv that the group is getting big, and it’s time to start thinking about multiplying. Her and Caleb went away separately to pray into it and they came back with my name and Sandra’s name each. Grace went away and did the same multiple months later and came to the same conclusion.

I had questions about how stable you needed to be, and sachini said you don’t have to be everything. God will use you for what you have.

Sachini also said she wanted me to come to kids church, to see what male role models look like. She said it’s important they see someone like me, I don’t understand it but I will be willing to give it a go.

As I type this I don’t even remember what the truths they spoke into me are, I guess that’s how hard these things go into my brain. Sachini said I am curious, I don’t ask surface level questions, and I generally want to know the deeper level. They also said that I’ve built this community with Saturday dinners. That I’ve got a heart for people.

I really appreciate it when godly people say these things to me, because it’s hard for me to believe it. Sometimes I just feel so unseen.

At the end of it idk how it started but I told sachini you are someone who is able to speak truth into people, and I found her and Sandra refreshing.

Later on, during the walk back to our cars, she thanked me for what I said. And I then delivered a part 2. Guys need a godly woman to speak truth into us. And sometimes I feel she’s reserved to speak, but I told her that what she has to say is absolutely valuable, that she’s discerning. And she later I forgot what she said, she said she sees that I really love god. I forgot the rest, but I felt we really had a wholesome moment, and I asked if I could give her a hug. And we hugged and left it at that. My heart is full.

  

### things to deal with

I think it’s time to deal with what happened in Sydney. And also to deal with my relationship with dad.

### Justine

Honestly sachini has really surprised me. Who she is as a person and the thing she says are very grounded. Things like how she wants to make her home a space for life group, and how she just needs the bare minimum, her own space and that’s all she needs. she’s just an absolute powerhouse of a godly woman.

And I think about my crush towards Justine, I don’t know her well enough to say that I’ve seen the fruits of the spirit. But I realize now that it’s important that the person shares the same vision of the future with me. I feel like god may want me to let this crush go, I’ll have to pray into this.

### prayer list

- Let the truths spoken by those you have sent to me sink deep into my heart
- Give me wisdom to know what to do with Justine
- Am I too passive in life?
- How do I walk confidently in your love.
- Grow me into the man you want me to become.
