### Justine long chat, and the proceeding peace and questions

On Monday night I had a super long chat with Justine, honestly it was prety fun. I enjoyed getting to know her, and I was definitely excited to get to know her better.

The next day, Grace texted me to say she’s free to catchup. She always appears at the most timely of times. It is also this day that I wrote in my journal that I felt God wants me to surrender Justine.

On Wednesday morning, I woke up at 6 and started worshipping. I opened myself up to God to hear what he has for me, and I felt a peace I’ve rarely felt. Last time I felt something like this was probably when I first surrendered at the bench.

- it was confusing, I wanted to get answers on what u should do, not to feel okay about being where I am.
- I also wrote: wow the peace is incredible, but I’m also worried, shouldn’t I be moving forward?
- A peace and joy floods my heart. It’s confusing though, I want to move forward with her, why do I feel so much peace when I surrender and trust God?
- I’m reminded by Abraham’s story.

  

I struggle, is surrendering to God doing nothing? Or is it doing it with an act of faith and trust God with the outcome? God works through people, but maybe only if people do something? I think part of me is even afraid to try, the tough season had me even not allowing myself rom to feel, to desire, to express.

### catchup with mai

First time seeing Mai in over a year, it was good to catchup as always, she’s always one of my soul friends. We had a nice dinner, good conversations and even did a bit of karaoke afterwards. We even spoke about faith a little bit, and I realize that the world really needs more of God, making ourselves the center of everything is a recipe for disaster, lack of peace. I understand why people spread the Gospel now, to have assurance of who we are. During the act of surrender it is gained.

### Rachel + word and worship

During the previous weekend, Rachel messaged me out of the blue. We had never really spoken before, but I just assumed that she wanted a friend and God was prompting her to talk to me somehow. And through a conversation she said that she feels really good leadership qualities. And I came as such a shock, because that was something that Viv and sachini were talking to me about just before.

I then encourage her to come to word and worship, but she was nervous to come. So the next day I made a deal with her that if she didn’t feel like it in 15 minutes she could leave. And she ended up coming and she loved the experience. Justine even sent me a screenshot oh Rachel telling her that she is coming. God is working.

### Seeing Grace/catch up

It was really good to see grace and catchup with some of the things in my mind. She said the holy spiritual has imparted a few things to her:

1. If I was looking at myself and her from a third person perspective, would I say yes Justine and I? Justine has been on and off with this guy for awhile, there’s clearly a soul tie. Even though the relationship has ended, things haven’t ended per se. It’s not good to get involved with her.
2. Because God loves me so much, he said that even though this person is not the person for me, he’s willing to let me try if this is what I want.
3. Justine knows I like her, she has a feeling about it.

  

I admitted that I’m entering a new season, and that I’ve just begun the rebuild of my life. Maybe it’s not the time or too early to be bringing someone. Also admittedly the Justine situation was tricky because I gave my heart first, then turned to God. I have now learnt that I should guard my heart at all times and let gods peace be the one that leads me.

I also learnt that Rachel can hear Gods voice, which makes the leadership thing mean a lot more.

We spoke about the profound peace I felt this week, and how several things are coming together, like how I’ve been praying to know myself in God, not finding myself in relationships, etc.

I felt like for the longest time I wasn’t hearing God because I gave my heart first, and the heart was unwilling to die to the part of me that wanted something deeper with her. Having a neutral heart posture is really important.

I feel like I’m finaly ready to move on.

### sachini late night bender

After dinner we went for açai, then bathroom break at village cinemas Knox. Then went to burkes lookout in mount dandenong.

Honestly the whole night was just really fun, we got to know each other, we laughed a lot, and we just had a blast enjoying each others company. It was kind of surreal how effortless it was.

Several fun moments happened, the boom gate, the sweet escape, we really laughed a lot. Also in the drive down the mountain she was like oh look at the telephone pole, oh look at the Joey. It was the little child in her and it was beautiful to see. On the drive back on Burwood highway, she’s like the streets are so quiet you can imagine everyone being asleep. And I was like what? They are asleep you don’t have to imagine it. And I slowed the car down to a complete stop and called it her “boom gate moment”.

As good as the night was, I feel like what I was there to do was speak truth into her. To let her know that she was hidden for a purpose, to lead the youth girls, because she was exemplify godly femininity, one that sought gods path and purpose over that of the worlds. And she said she really needed that.

I also told her my testimony, and she said I encompass Hope.

I also thought maybe I started to like her, but I’m really guarding my heart on this one, I want gods peace to guide me and this doesn’t feel like it at the moment.

### sachini late night bender part 2

Ok something is going on here.

We go to the leaders meeting, is just the two of us. And it was fine, after that we prayed for each other which is the first time I’ve prayed for someone in that way. By the. End of the night, she said I did a good job.

and then we just kept walking around, then went to blind creek, then went for a drive around, and it was just like fun?

Then later went for a drive too. Showing her how to one hand drive. And we just didn’t really want to leave each other?

I remember we just sat at in th car in the suburb, talking in the car about anything, and it just never ended?

Towards the end, she admitted to me that men like me do exist. And I told her her grounded ness is everything. She also mentioned time flew past.

God, I need you. I don’t want to do this on my own. Help me to honor you with what I do, amen.

Do I like her for what we could experience together? Or do we like each other for what we can do for god?

Have I done enough growing in God for this to happen?

Couples ministry? Leading young men and women

Do we draw each other closer to God?

Am I well enough?

I remember the way she dove head first into my hug when I offered to hug her
