### BJJ

First time back at BJJ in about a month. Had a lot of people with new stripes and new belts. And honestly had my butt handed to me, Jaq was just improving so fast, and it made me really sad. It was the hardest I’ve gone at sparring in awhile too.

Brian did say that if we needed help, to talk to him, especially if we’ve plateaued. I’ve been meaning to do this but honestly I just haven’t had the leap of the faith to do it yet,

### Morning walks

After saturdays day out at Lorne, I was very inspired to continue to spend time outdoors. So I started mornings with an hour walk in nature outdoors, and it’s been quite a lift to my mood this week. It’s also a fantastic time to worship and soak in gods presence. I’ll definitely be doing this a lot more.

### wednesday dinner at top noodle house

After being at home for most of the week, I just needed to get out of the house. I find it hard to stay home for long periods of time. Maybe it’s a sign that I’m further along in my recovery.

### justine

I took a leap of faith and messaged Justine, to see if she wanted to go to an art gallery. It turned into a very long chat conversation which lasted most of the night. I was quite excited honestly because we hadn’t really interacted with her this way before but also hesitant about my excitement because I’m sometimes overwhelmed by how strongly I feel.

One of the bigger things that happened was that she admitted she was having sex with her ex when they were still together. The moment she said that something descended upon me. Idk if it was the spirit of lust or what it was, but it felt super strange and not pleasant. And it even woke me up in the early hours of the day after I fell asleep.

During the conversation, we prayed for each other which was kinda nice… but I also don’t want to be her comfort pillow. I think I liked our conversation a bit too much and I’m not sure what to do with it. I don’t want to be the one that’s hyping it up too much in my head. I also feel like the emotional transaction is kinda one sided, just get the sense that I’m the one asking questions and there’s kinda very little coming back from where she’s at.

But the one thing I liked was that I handled this far better this time around than in September, I consistently and constantly surrendered it to god, and I feel like I wasn’t phased as much. Y things. Just focused the fact that I need so much god in my life. And when my feelings popping up were super strong, I just praised god for making me someone who feels so strongly, that has the heart capacity to feel such a way for someone. This was something I never did before and it’s been such a saving grace because in the past the enemy just used it against me and over time grew so afraid of my heart and my capacity to feel.

At the same time, Sandra went MIA for a long time, and the normal me would get nervous and all that and wonder if it’s me.. and in the past it felt like I had no defense against it. But this time around I said no, there’s nothing wrong with me, be gone! And in general just being more and more rebellious against it.

### Reflections of the soft heart

Now I realise that a lot of my early young adult romantic pains came from exercising my soft heart in ways that were probably too eager. Erica, Becky, Allena. All the times I felt inadequate, felt less than. Looking back now, my soft heart is such a gift, and praise god that after all I’ve been through it continues to be a heart that loves, that thinks the best of people and gives what it has. The enemy has lied to me on one of gods greatest gifts to me.

### Saturday after church plans

After church we went for dinner, and they made spontaneous plans to go to karaoke. I initially did not want to go and I prayed a lot about it. And eventually somehow went, thinking I can just leave half way through or something. But in the end I ended up staying to the end. And I surprised myself at how I felt after, I felt better. Whereas the last time I went karaoke with them. There were points throughout the night where I just felt very inadequate for someone like Justine. But I told the devil to stop his lies and rebuked it, and surrendered to gods purpose and ways. I remember immediately after the dinner there was a short interaction with her at the car and I felt like the energy was so weird. Having gone back home I just surrendered all of it to gods feet, to be still, and know that he is god.

### more on justine

I feel like I’m at an impasse. I know I like her, but reality is not really matching up with anything at the moment. My feelings aren’t budging, the situation isn’t changing as far as I can tell. I’m disappointed, uncertain, and confused as to what to do next. I feel like god is telling me to stand firm, idk is it really from god? I do feel peace when I do so.

### Birthday paddle boarding

Started the day a bit more rough. Felt super stressed and overwhelmed. But just worshipped and brought it to god, and afterwards I felt a bit better. But the day was honestly amazing.

Just a lot of fellowship, a lot of paddle boarding and a lot of fun.

Some of the noteworthy things happened when we were at Betty’s burger. And I sat next to Clement. During which he mentioned that David tan was very surprised about my spiritual transformation. And it sparked a tangent with viv where she was saying Chris Alex was also equally as surprised. And I said something like I have a Loki character arc, and was absolutely villainous . And everyone was cheering me on and that was a super wholesome moment and added so much to my bucket.

The other thing that happened was we watched the sunset. During which everyone put their hands on me and prayed over me. That was so wholesome and really heartwarming. But tbh I feel like I’m having trouble letting myself feel the emotions of it.

The overall feeling is that I’m exactly where I want to be. Compared to last year where I spent my birthday alone, this year I’m in the presence of god and friends. The leap of faith to celebrate my birthday was elevated in gods hands. I want to continue to grow close to god and to seek what he has for me.
