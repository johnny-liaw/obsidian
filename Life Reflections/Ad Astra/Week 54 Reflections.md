The week I was mostly sick so I quarantined at home, I also felt like I was idolizing marriage, sex, kids and women so I started praying for deliverance from that.

### Saturday YA Camp

The camp was honestly really good, it was a day out with friends essentially. The highlight was definitely that conversation I had with grace where she asked me what sachini meant. So I played her the recordings. And after she said something along the lines of from a woman’s perspective, she already likes you. She then said that she’s been praying really heavily into It and she feels like god said yes. But she wasn’t sure so she kept praying about it and praying until she said she thinks it’s a yes. But I need to run it by my mom first. And that this relationship will be tough if it does happen because the enemy will try and pull you apart.

After this I was just dumbfounded. Because I felt like I had been hidden and passed over for so long that to even be able to consider the possibility of something like this happening was just surreal. I admitted to Grace that earlier in the missions elective, the presenting couple spoke about the knowing your mission in god first. And I felt that if I died tomorrow, I would’ve really loved to raise up a group of godly young men and women. And I’d really love to do it with sachini. Earlier in the week I also ran into the idea of partnership in Christ, and everything else is built on top of it. Just felt like a lot of arrows were pointing at her, but I very much do not want to feel like I’m being driven by my emotions.

Very soon after the conversation with grace was the night session, and the worship was really powerful. And I was just in my zone asking god what is his will for me. To be led by the spirit and not by the flesh. To not have this happen if it’s not what he wants. And I went really deep honestly and I was even kneeling.

Raquel’s message also really slayed. I understand why 2024 was so bad now, it was because god trusted my character. There was no joy for the longest time because my only joy had to be in him. Hopes were struck down because my hopes had to be in him.

I felt like during worship it came to mind, with or without something more. I still want to lead with her.

### Rachel Incident

i was rude to Rachel. I need to do better in communicating when under duress or impatience.

### sunday

The whole day I’ve been sort of meditating and seeking God. And I felt really strange from all of it. I didn’t know what god wanted for me, I was very careful not to involve my own hopes in a relationship or to worship the idea of something more with her. I wanted to be led by the spirit. But there is this opening of my chest and heart that’s been very evident since last night. I can’t tell whether it’s from the spirit or from the flesh.

I feel like when I think of something more with her, it’s peaceful. And that really really scares me.because it’s almost like accepting a blessing from god when you’re so used to not getting it. But it’s also a wait, not yet?

If we get out in situations to conform to the image of Christ so we may serve better and love more. Would me going deeper with sachini do that?
