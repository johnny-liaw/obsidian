|[[Untitled 12]]|had a dream that I was initially in a chinese military base. Dodging cars/planes and what not. Inside there is a building, and a secret american hideout was inside. In it there’s a green room with orange square tiles. And underneath it was a latch where a little man will come out only when no one was around. Felt like God was saying there's something in you that shouldn't be there, you can't be the one to cast it out because it hides when you come looking.|September 5, 2024|DD-2|
|[[Untitled 10]]|We were initially at some cafe, all of a sudden five waiters came up to us and gave us really exemptional service of all these dishes which we were not expecting at all because we just want a coffee. Honestly I feel like I was having a good time. Afterwards when we were saying goodbye, I kiss it goodbye on the forehead, and I think a part of me and you then I liked her more than she liked me. The palace of Versailles in Melbourne CBD or something like that.  <br>  <br>This was dreamt awhile ago but idk the date so just adding it to Sept 5|September 5, 2024|DD-29|

I would say this week was the most vulnerable I’ve ever been

### Ken Fish Encounter / Opening up to Mom

Drove an hour out to healesville to see Ken Fish in a small gym. The atmosphere and energy was honestly pretty amazing. Got up to get prayer for shame and I felt something small shift. I can’t really explain it. Afterwards on the way back I just felt really angry at mom.

And we had a really hoenst conversation where i explained to her some of the things she did to me as a kid. The shame/anger I felt and how I was just trying to run away from home. It felt like a big release and I felt lighter after.

### Justine Prophecy

Following on from Saturday’s evening dinner with Justine and co. I realized that in my 3rd dream there was a prophecy about her. I relayed it to her and it turned out to be true. Before I did I prayed to God to let me just be a messenger and remove selfish ambition.

During the week I definitely let myself get carried away with fantasies about her. I even got on my knees to pray for her multiple times. I definitely felt tremendous anguish/confusion/lack of peace throughout the week as well.

### Weds Ken Fish / Justine situation

On wednesday I felt very off, I kept looking in the direction of Justine hoping to catch her. I felt like my focus was just entirely on her, expecting something. Afterwards it felt like there was elements of self shaming because nothing happened, idk i’m beginning to notice that something was odd

### telling mom about dreams

Opening up further to Mom, I told her about the dreams I had. And the Justine situation. Mom said it could be a relationship, but we won’t know for sure, but we must be patient. I’m glad I’m opening up to mom more. Feels like I’m dealing with my shame and various issues.

### Saturday church goings

Had a 1.5hr convo with Grace + Caleb. Grace straight up said she thinks it’s of the flesh, which honestly hit me not in a good way. Afterwards said to quarantine me from Justine and all that stuff which felt just wrong honestly, it’s measures are quite extreme. I just went into church service feeling very unfocused, rattled and unhappy. She basically told me to keep pressing into God and to understand what his will is for me. Pursuing Justine while she has her entanglements could prove problematic for the LG at large if it doesn’t workout.

Durng the church service, I realized that I have the same problem Ellie has, the unwillingness to stay single.

After church, I pulled Megz aside to have a good chat with her about what had just happened. But as we were walking out I saw Sachini + Justine in the back row by themselves. As I walked out I didn’t look at them but I just felt that there was a really weird energy about them.

When we got to foresthill, Justine seemed normal in the elevator up. But afterwards her and Sachini quite abruptly left by themselves, which I thought was strange too.

Dinner I wasn’t great, I was checking out. It’d just been a very emotinally taxing day, with lots of emotions like confusion, anger, disappointment that I needed to sort out. It felt like the earlier days of BO where my nervous system was switched on and couldn’t come back down to a baseline. Honestly felt like leaving a few times.

During dinner I saw Justine leaning on Sachini’s shoulder, and that was really perplexing cus when did they become so close.

After I got home, I was just really upset/angry for reasons I can’t explain. I kept spiralling and thought that my convo was leaked and Justine knows, i was angry at everyone and I thought I needed to leave the LG. I was going through so much anguish.

I realize that pride comes up when there’s a lot of hurt.

### Caleb 2h conversation

I decided to call Caleb for 2 hrs and hash things out, turns out it was just a misunderstanding.

He said that the LG was dead before I came. That i’d done alot despite what I was going through. ‘high functioning’ was the word he used. He said I don’t give myself enough credit. Even someone like Victoria is coming out of her shell. I need to hold on to this abit more.

I’m glad to have Caleb as a friend.

### On the journey of working through my issues

I realized that the dreams of all the girls, it’s probably God telling me that women are too prominent in my life. I get carried away with it. And it’s revealed a whole heap of issues as well. I really want to breakfree of this mindset of constantly scanning of ‘her’. To be content with being single.

Things I want to break free from:

- constantly looking around the corner
- performance based evaluations
- be happy in singleness
- free from shame, free from self loathing behaviour.
- acceptance for who i am
- liking what i see in the mirror
- image focused / self concious
- not define myself by women /reactions i get from women too much.
