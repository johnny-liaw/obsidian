### My 5 loaves and 2 fish

There were two events that happened that were particularly notable.  
  

I caught up with Kendrick, finally. And by God's grace, the little I had turned into an excellent catch up. It was very soulful, and it was exactly what I needed. Thinking back now, that Monday catch up was more fulfilling than the big group catch up at Caleb's. My heart yearns for more intimacy with friends.

The other thing that happened, was when Julia commended me for getting blended design project almost out of staff. Even though I feel like I haven't been working that much, I feel like this is what God is telling me, which is I donate to be more than who I am. Just give what I can, and God will do the rest. This is also very much in line with Amy's workshop on Wednesday, where the words don't strive or cease striving kept standing out to me.

### Energy fatigue

This week was super difficult, after the crash on Saturday the week previous I really tough week. Even up until Wednesday where I couldn't really think straight/feel straight/express straight. On top of that, I took Monday off as well because things just were not that great. Started taking iron pills to supplement, and really making sure I have enough iron content. To what's the letter end of the week, it seems to be working well so far. They were very many dark clouds this week. For future Johnny, if it ever happens again, just know that you'll make it out of it. Use this week's log as evidence. God will deliver you.

### Fire night at Caleb's

It was a good night of conversation, I did find myself leaning towards Sandra and sachini. But I still feel like something was missing at the end of it, like something unsatisfactory you are and satisfying. I feel like I'm just missing that intimacy, with people that truly care.  
  

In the passing conversation, and raise the idea of of anxiety related to health. I feel like I have this, where my perceived ability to do things is a lot lower than actually is. Something to explore further in future times.

### Dating

I downloaded coffee meets bagel this week. Partially because I felt like I should do something about my dating life, but I really feel like it just makes you feel like you're doing something but you aren't really. Also admit that they could be an element of getting ahead of God's timing.  
  

I also started thinking about code approach a lot more, but my mind has many knots about it. On one end, if it's within God's parameters, wouldn't it be acceptable? But on the other end, how do I know that this is a blessed path for me? I just don't really know what I have to do, and I feel like it was a lot of time where I would straight away act on that impulse. But today, after a long time of trying to work it out in my head I realize that I'm going down the same path, and what I really need is discernment, and I just need to pray into a really hard and seek counsel from those around me. Not rush into anything, but to do so with good wisdom, and God's blessing. Because even if I achieve what I want to achieve, but without God's blessing, is it really fulfilling? Probably not.
