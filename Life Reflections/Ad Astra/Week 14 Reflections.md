This week was one with ups and downs.

I started the week feeling better than I’ve felt in a very long time. Had a therapy session earlier in the week and usually I have a big energy crash after but I felt surprisingly okay. Leading up to Lifegroup on Wednesday I honestly felt like I was on the up and up. During Lifegroup I socialized, I expressed and I made jokes as my normal self, a self I hadn’t seen in a very long time. However, when I got home I felt a certain mood drop. Like the one where my nervous system had a bit too much. That got me really low because I thought I had been doing so well, and was on the path to normality. A part of me is also terrified of what a dysfunctional nervous system means, as the memories of those torturous times come back to me, from the last weeks of Sydney and the first few weeks in Melbourne.

I spoke to God, why am I back here? Do you not want me to be myself in front of people? To express and enjoy good company? As I was showering, the thought came to mind “Surrender lifting yourself up so God can be the one to do so”. Truth be told, sometimes socializing is a bit of a performance. I want to achieve a certain outcome, uphold a certain image, and I think that’s why my nervous system is so shot. There’s just so much work. Then I started asking myself the question, what would it mean to be vulnerable in Christ? To be willing to show your imperfections, the jagged edges, to adorn your weaknesses, so that you may examplify God’s strength? I had no answer to that. I sometimes hide behind the funny mask, without it I’m not even sure who I am. Without playing a role, upholding an image, I’m sometimes unsure how I should present myself in front of people. It’s why I hide myself from others. I’m ashamed of what’s left of me without the mask.

On Saturday evening, after dinner with the Lifegroup, which was another great time with friends. More normal than I’ve felt in such a long time. I found myself unable to come down from that high. The message that weekend coincidentally mentioned “Base and Phase”. What happened with friends was a phase, not a base. Whereas the way I was living before, I was trying to make a phase, my base. I really disliked not being able to come down from that high, I wanted to have a normal nervous system. One that was not so shot all the time, that could self regulate. This is maybe some mindset thing I could work on with Scott.

During the dinner with friends, it was such a great time. And then I realized that I had a way with people, a way of talking and a wit that was fast. I was so high off of the interactions and connections but it still didn’t feel enough. Maybe that’s why I find the need to make the phase my base. So I asked God, help me use what you’ve given me for your glory, and to examplify your grace. I no longer want to do these things for me. I then wrote these few principles of interacting with people:

  

1. Putting God at the center of it all
2. Authenticity
3. Coming from the perspective of love, to serve and build them up
4. Let God be the one that protects and lifts you up

  

It’s been a long journey, but I’ve finally began to learn about the mask I’ve been putting on for so long. In some ways I look forward to learning about the me under all those layers of deception. To maybe even learn to deeply connect with those around me, without the need of the funny mask or playing a role. To not boast about my righteousness, to be okay with being small, so God may be the one that lifts me.
