Story: had a dream that I was initially in a chinese military base. Dodging cars/planes and what not. Inside there is a building, and a secret american hideout was inside. In it thereâ€™s a green room with orange square tiles. And underneath it was a latch where a little man will come out only when no one was around. Felt like God was saying there's something in you that shouldn't be there, you can't be the one to cast it out because it hides when you come looking.
