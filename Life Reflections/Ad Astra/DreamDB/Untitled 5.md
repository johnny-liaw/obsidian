Story: I had a dream where I was being delivered of things by Ken Fish. He got a lot of stuff out I remember vomiting like crazy and he even wiped my snot at some point. There was another guy there, it kind of looked like David Tan. I remember looking at him for so long I just couldn’t recognize him but looking back I think it’s him. This dream was so vivid. There were pastors there at some point (this might’ve happened before the deliverance). Some kinda different event. And there’s this guy who was telling a story, he had a strong angry outburst. The pastor said that’s fanna. In the dream i interepreted that as the evil spirit. I feel lighter after I woke up, so interesting.I remember Dave having a story to tell, it looked like he was really heavy. He didn’t want to tell it, just get a sense that he’s very troubled. I’m very spiritually sensitive, that’s why the 1st ayahuasca was so hard on me. But in general I have to watch the activities I take part in, the people I hang around.
