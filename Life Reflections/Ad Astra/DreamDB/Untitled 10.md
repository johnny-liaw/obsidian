Story: We were initially at some cafe, all of a sudden five waiters came up to us and gave us really exemptional service of all these dishes which we were not expecting at all because we just want a coffee. Honestly I feel like I was having a good time. Afterwards when we were saying goodbye, I kiss it goodbye on the forehead, and I think a part of me and you then I liked her more than she liked me. The palace of Versailles in Melbourne CBD or something like that.This was dreamt awhile ago but idk the date so just adding it to Sept 5
