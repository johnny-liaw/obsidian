Story: "I was at uni with Aryan and a bunch of other people I don't recognize. And there was a problem festering in the background, I think it was about a girl. And whenever it would get brought up I would just freeze. To the point where Aryan is like what bothers you so much about it? And I said it's because I'm so scared. I remember the uni had classes where you could sign up for stuff and I signed up for photography. I remember Aryan and I talking at another point and I said I didn't do anything majorly wrong, and he had this look on my face and he said you didn't do anything wrong at all.        "
