Story: Had a dream earlier in the week where I was forcing a guy in the bathroom to take drugs. And then when I tried doing it for a while, he kept screaming and people were noticing and so I started to run away. I was wondering around the city and I finally came to a gate of sorts, when I tried to enter a guy stop me and when I try to leave you would pull me back and I couldn't get away. After this I woke up .I woke up feeling like my heart was very corrupted, and I feel very impure. I guess that makes sense because I was having a really tough weekend prior, I was questioning a lot of things such as my mental health and my singleness and just overall complaining a lot to God. And I think this is a lesson that my heart gets corrupted when I complain.
