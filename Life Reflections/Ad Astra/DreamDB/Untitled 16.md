Story: Godwin pulls me aside, and all of a sudden we go into a strange place, and he goes we’ve met before. And I go i don’t think so. He said the first time we met i was really rude. He tried to give me some money but I said it was the wrong currency.he then repeated a dream only i can know. But I don’t remember what that dream was. But deep down, he saw what I had to go through.I forgot the rest, the image of baos in a pot, slowly heating up. Because you choose to. Choose to overcome it. And I just became better, or something. What stood out was a sense of calm and peaceful, from the dream. In a way seen. It feels like a msg from God to go to Godwin. Go to Godwin because a sense of he has something for me.
