Story: Woke up in the middle of the night with a distinct conviction, keep your eyes closed, get ready. And then a wave of fear and terror started washing over me. I canâ€™t remember the last time a spiritual attack was so evident since may/june 2024. Eventually the wave subsided, this was off the back of praying for spiritual sight and the ability to surrender my romantic life to god fully.
