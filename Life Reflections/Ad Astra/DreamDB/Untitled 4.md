Story: It was a larger dream but I don’t really remember it, only glimpses of this one. I was with my sister, and there were these two other girls as well. When I woke up I didn’t know who they were but in the dream I definitely knew them. They text me and they said “are you okay?”Something about my mental health. And I was like how do you know that? There’s no possible way for you to know that.And then I remember being prayed for by someone, I’m not sure who but I remember Erica was part of the dream as well. I don’t think she was the one praying for me though.Wnile being prayed for, I just remember fighting the prayer. I kept wanting to get up out of it but I felt like a spell that was holding me under, which was confusing. It’s almost as if I didn’t know which side to pick.
