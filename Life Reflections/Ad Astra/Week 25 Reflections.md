> Had a dream, and one of them was bout NY. Is that really what I feel, or is that what I wished I felt? Wow.

> Had another dream, I wasn’t going to BJJ because I’d lost the path to get to blue belt. What does this dream mean?

### The move

The move this week was honestly hectic, and really challenged me. I feel like at times I was checking out because the expectation/the extra work scares me. I feel like I’m going to crash or hit some kind of an emotional bottom. But oddly I held up better than I thought, do I perhaps have more than I think?

It did reveal to me that my relationship with expectation and goals is not particularly great, as I look at it from the perspective of fear/anxiety and trying my best to minimize the number of expectations that I have.

### wednesday church vulnerability

During wednesday’s word&worship, I really wanted to go up and get prayer but I didn’t. Despite Viv/Erica’s prompts. I’m not very good at being vulnerable. Eventually they were able to coax me to have a private prayer session with just the two of them. So we went into a quiet corner, and I confessed that I’ve always felt like something is wrong with me. And I strive/do to be accepted and worthy. My mind also goes blank near the spot of emotional vulnerability. They prayed for me and it was hoenestly really nice. I can feel a part of me trying to claw back the xperience because showing that much vulnerability is usually a bad thing for me.

Why does the Devil want to hide that part of me? My emotional vulnerability. Is there something there that perhaps could be valuable to people?

### Sat night

Sat night was good, but I went away feeling very labored. I think I tried too hard to uphold an image, and I felt spiritually dirty afterwards. I was trying so hard to be funny that it took away opportunity for deeper connection. I feel ashamed thinking of this now. I hide way too much behind the funny mask, so I don’t have to show the real self to the world. I also felt proud when we were discussing mortgages, I dislike feeling proud. I have sinned.

Father God, help me to examplify who you created m,e to be. Help me to root my identity in you and please you, and not look for things of the world.

### Working on my mental game

The athletes at the olympics often work on their mental game, I think i should do the same. I realize I have negative mentalities when I face expectation/goals. And I’ve also recently realized that I’ve felt like there is something overarchingly wrong with me. It took a while after Scott’s thing to digest and hit. I look too much to my performance/the world for validation and a sense of self.

### rs to hide brokenness inside

Here’s a recap of all the girls I’ve messed with/had a relationship with/had a thing for in the past:

Yellow highlights means crushes that didn’t really go anywhere.

1. Claire
    1. This is when I moved to Melbourne, started abandoning God and trusting myself.
2. ==Erica Tan==
3. ==Becky Lin==
4. Janice
    1. I got into the relationship to fill a void, and when we had sex and broke up, i guess it broke me even more.
5. That malay chick
6. Melissa? met her one time
7. Sophie
8. Jacinta
9. Leila
10. ==Isabel Bang==
11. Euiyoung
12. ==The filipino chick I got really excited for, but turned out she lying==
13. Aneesha
14. Ashley
15. Melissa (sydney)
16. Jess (sydney)
17. ==Justine==

  

There were quite a few examples of girls whom I completely misread the situation and had wayyy to much expectations. Put on the rose tinted glasses.

  

And most of the girls I’ve had a more intimate relationship with, except maybe the first and the last, ended for various reasons.

1. 1 time thingos, nothing much to it.
2. Physicality (janice, sophie, jacinta, euiyoung, aneesha, ashley, melissa) where I just felt so empty afterwards. With the exception of Leila, idk why I thought we should go to that party instead of being with each other. Probably related.
3. Most of the above, except for maybe Euiyoung, and a little bit of Ashley/Melissa, were lacking in emotional intimacy. With Euiyoung, I said things like “I dont want to be in a relationship” and made her really sad because I wanted to fix this brokenness within me. And being in a relationship would take me away from the chance to fix it.
4. For Ashley/Melissa, they were truly great girls. But I feel a part of it was they didn’t meet my standard for a girl? I feel like I was always comparing them to some idealized image of who I should be dating, and cus they weren’t that, I wasn’t really appreciating them. And not letting myself get close. I was also quite focused on SD at the time, focused on fixing the brokenness within. I still remember when Melissa said “the more you try and find yourself, the more you lose yourself”. When I’ve been too focused on doing things my way, and doing things selfishly, things go wrong.
5. My unrelenting expectations also goes towards women. If i date a girl of x caliber, then I’m good enough.

Father God, I’ve got many many thoughts, forgive me for all the sins in the past I’ve committed in the past against these women. Work through me Father God, show me how I can improve and be whole in you.
