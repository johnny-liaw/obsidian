|[[Untitled 13]]|Had a dream last night that I walked past a table and Louie Pan was there. And then afterwards it was Phuc, and then after it was Ryan.  <br>  <br>Later on in the dream Zi showed up too.  <br>  <br>Such a strange dream, why do these people from the past keep showing up? Is God telling me to go to the reunion?|September 16, 2024|DD-33|
|[[Untitled 16]]|Godwin pulls me aside, and all of a sudden we go into a strange place, and he goes we’ve met before. And I go i don’t think so. He said the first time we met i was really rude. He tried to give me some money but I said it was the wrong currency.  <br>  <br>he then repeated a dream only i can know. But I don’t remember what that dream was. But deep down, he saw what I had to go through.  <br>  <br>I forgot the rest, the image of baos in a pot, slowly heating up. Because you choose to. Choose to overcome it. And I just became better, or something.  <br>  <br>What stood out was a sense of calm and peaceful, from the dream. In a way seen. It feels like a msg from God to go to Godwin. Go to Godwin because a sense of he has something for me.|September 17, 2024|DD-35|
|[[Untitled 18]]|Another dream about Justine. We were with a group of friends, she has this lower back pain. Clement was in the dream.  <br>  <br>There was a snippet about rats in a car, they were shot out. They were roaming the land and they were getting smarter or something, gaining concentration. idk what to make of this.|September 19, 2024|DD-36|
|[[Untitled 15]]|Another dream with Ellie. She was with Viv + Megz, after being with them for awhile, she starts to open up to my mom or something? The drugs she’s taking. And afterwards she sees the light. Then she becomes nicer and starts talking me.|September 22, 2024|DD-37|
|[[Untitled 14]]|Had another dream about Jess. This time we were in a car or something, and we’re talking about our past life after breaking up. I just distinctly remember her being set on girls. I just feel sorry for her that she’s so lost.|September 22, 2024|DD-38|
|[[Untitled 17]]|Had a dream that I was in a church, and on stage was a couple of pastors that were in a panel or something. And then I think I saw someone really beautiful, she’s asian and she has puffy hair. The pastor was talking about sex and relationships or something. He said if you get a girl pregnant you die (pre martial thingo).  <br>  <br>Afterwards I got transported to a scene, with Adam and Justine. Wanted to do approaches, and Justine was like is this legal, is this fine? And she walked off, she wasin’t cool wtih it. I then started telling Adam what happened after I came up, cus I didn’t want to do training anymore. **I felt like I never want to work for my self esteem again.**  <br>  <br>  <br>I feel like the gist of that dream is that I work for my self esteem, and my need for a relationship, cus I find comfort in it.|September 22, 2024|DD-39|

  
  

### Bootstrap headaches

On wednesday Vee, messages me with an urgent msg that we’re out of bootstrap flags, and whether I can help. I said yes and started messaging owners. I feel like that really knocked me off axis as I haven’t lived off slack for awhile. The next few days I proceeded to live on a heightened level of anxiety/tension cus bootstrap flags were full. Neck stiffness, face tightness, the whole lot. It wasn’t a great few days, but I really just surrendered it to God and allowed him to guide me. I felt like it build my faith. I prayed everyday `I want what you have for me, give me the peace that transcends all understanding`.

It was definitely extremely uncomfortable to be back in a place where your face is tight, your head is heady, and you’re just overall not thinking very straight.

### Saturday dinner

When I got to church, i started feeling off. I was distant from social conversation, i felt very fatigued. Unresponsive to social stuff. Decided to go to dinner and felt like it was just the wrong decision looking back. Because i was already emotionally depleted, i wasn’t very chill at dinner and definitely red lined myself. I was just knackered after.

I feel like I’ve got this expectation on myself to be funny all the time. I don’t like it. I don’t want to get my identity from being ridiculous. I feel unclean. God help me to continiously seek you for my identify, and not find it in approval or things in this world.

And right now on Sunday, im definitely paying the price. I jsut feel very lackluster, unengaged, unmotivated, very fatigued, heady, unenergetic. And I have to catchup with Kendrick tomorrow, I’m just not sure how I’m gonna do.
