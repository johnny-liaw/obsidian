This week was a tough one. I was added to the help-editing cop roster, and by Tuesday I was getting flustered with all the tasks that weren’t progressing. At night I had a sort of anxiety episode where I had trouble calming down and mom needed to sleep in my bed. What contributed to it was the fact that afterwork I tried to help out with the house stuff but it just overloaded me.

The next day I took the day off work, I repeatedly asked God, why? And I feel what came back to me was I put my identity in my work, how much I get done, what my boss Julia might say about me if I don’t (trying to win people’s approval). Whereas my desires should be that of the kingdom of God. I feel this is the next piece of work ahead of me.

I returned to work the next day (Thursday), got through it, was tough. Same happened for Friday, and got through it. I don’t remember much of what happened. But I know what happened was consistent walks, weight lifting sessions and trivia night (community on wednesday).

On Saturday, I went to church at my usual time and surprisingly Justine was there. We had some moments where we talked about our common water bottle. I remember there was also once where she hit me on the shoulder when i was asking Anna a question. During worship my prayer to God was that I root my identity in him, and not circumstances/happenings/things of the world. I don’t want to get caught up in reading into things, and trust that he’ll provide what I need for the plan that he has for me.

Afterwards I grabbed dinner with Caleb, Chenchen and Anna at Straits cafe. There was some theology discussions and it was great to talk about our faith/our opinions and our journeys. It felt like the type of discussion I had been praying for, praise God. What I want moving forward is to ask more questions, I talked too much and felt like i inadvertently exalted myself too much. I want to be a student, I want to be less.

On Sunday my mood rating was probably 3.5. It was quite low and honestly didn’t really feel like doing much besides staying in bed and reading my bible. But mom enticed me out of bed with dimsum, we watched TV for a bit and went on a long walk where we just looked at houses. It was actually quite nice and we talked a lot. She tried to ask some questions about Adam and I brushed it off, to me I’ve internalized a lot of shame about the Adam part. It might be something to explore in my own journals.

I admitted to her that I feel moving to Sydney was a mistake, and she said not to dwell on it, but to learn from it. And to continue to be patient for God only gave Abraham his son after 20 years or something like that. I want to continue to confess my sins and shames to those around me.

At home, I was reading the Bible and I somehow felt really called to learn more about Jesus. So after Joel or something I started reading the New Testament again. While in my room I could hear my parents discussing matters about the housing project, and I could feel anxiety rising out of me. I felt God told me then to **stop, observe, and watch me work**.

I forgot what podcast I was listening to this week, but it says that our esteem cannot be achieved, but is received. I continue to ask God to show me who he created me to be, and to help me put my identity in him, amen.
