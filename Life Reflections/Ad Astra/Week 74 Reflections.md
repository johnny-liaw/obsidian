Okay, so I just had a chat with Jaiden, the staff engineer. And honestly, after this, after the therapy session, I just really felt the sense that I did not want to strive to protect my image, protect my reputation anymore. I just wanted to live on my... I don't want to live in the shadow of how unacceptable I feel I am. I want to be accepted. I know I am accepted and I want to live that fact. And so I just kind of dropped a show a little bit in my catch up with him. I asked him about his thoughts on editing. And I asked him like, "Imposter Syndrome. What are your thoughts on it?" And he said, "Surprisingly, I feel it massively." And I was chatting with another staff engineer yesterday and he was feeling it too. He said he was scared to post something in a Slack channel. And honestly, that was super relieving because I thought it was just me. So that was really good. And he encourage me. He said, "Yeah, no, you're doing good work. It's okay. Everyone feels it big time." And he also mentioned that he has never been as stressed as his time at Canva in the first six months because expectations are really high. He felt really inadequate, etc. So it was just super interesting and super relieving to hear him say that. And really, I opened it and I just dropped the shield and dropped the striving. I feel his weight lifted for me. So good.

### Thursday

At night, my mood significantly worsened because I was trying not to act out of striving, but that just ended up laying another yoke on myself. I was very tense and I was very uncomfortable. I was having stomach aches. And on to the next day, it was, yeah, I got tired really quickly. It was not pleasant.
