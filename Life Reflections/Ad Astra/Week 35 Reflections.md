### The struggle for meaning.

This week I struggled massively with meaning. Mental health and gut health wise it's better this week than it's ever been I think. All of a sudden there's a vacuum left behind that was preoccupied with pain/suffering/fatigue is now reclaimed. What's left behind is a sense of “what do I do now?”. I just felt everything was empty, and meaningless. I was going through the motions of life, time is passing and I feel it just has a lack of meaning. So I've responded by being on my phone more this week than other weeks, chatting to Sandra to pass the time and distract myself. Is this what God wants for me? That is what true meaning is. The dreams this week have also been rather quiet.

### Justine detachment

Earlier in the week, I think Tuesday. I started praying for detachment. Its too complicated, too muddy. Wouldn't something have happened by now if it was meant to be? I've been praying so long for signs but the circumstances have spoken for itself.

### Justine pt 2

On Saturday night we went for the DFN dinner, it was honestly quite good. But Justine ended up dropping the bombshell that she's back with her boyfriend. I think in me there was a shock and that surprised me, it actually stung. Even Sandra noticed it too and she said I became really quiet and reclined back in my chair.

The rest of the night was kind of okay, it was kind of marred by this. Where a portion of mind was stuck in that shock state.

I'm not sure what I expected, I was looking to surrender her to God, which was why I was surprised it hurt in the first place.

That night I was in a lot of anguish. I didn't sleep much. I was going through all sorts of options like should I visit other lifegroups? Should I just not even see her for a couple months? Why am I in this situation? Is God trying to teach me something? Did I do something wrong? What am I supposed to do now? Am I running away because I feel very exposed?

I have so many questions.

I did come to the realization that my social needs are all dependent on LG at the moment. I'm not too sure that's a good idea. Everytime I have lg or church there's kind of a lot of pressure for those events/people to fill my needs. But that's just not practical. And I come away feeling dissatisfied sometimes cus I don't have any other way to fill it. That and the Justine situation made me realize how much I needed to do things outside of lifegroup, but I'm also petrified of it. **Dad was right I've been hiding for a very long time.**

The one thing I do like about what I'm doing now is that I'm not rushing ahead to solve this, I'm seeking God and I'm seeking counsel. Not rushing into anything.

I just feel this crush is just cumbersome, annoying and not helpful. I feel embarrassed and stupid that it has gotten to this point.

This very afternoon Sandra sent me an IG clip about striving to justify our existence, foregoing play and joy in the process. It really hit me.
