### a dream about entitlement

I feel like I had a minor dream that I don’t really deserve the goodness god has shown in my life. Do we really deserve anything in the first place though? Everything is given by gods grace.

### Justine

I felt really strongly for her still, and. This week I started praying the prayer of surrendering my heart to god. And I prayed to god if there’s something I should do to let it go. And I felt at some point through out the week something came to me and it showed me that I was holding on to a version of me that liked her. I think this started when I started thinking of letting go, but I had resistance towards it, but what’s wrong with letting go? So clearly something in me is holding in an unhealthy way. I renounce that attachment, and welcome the spirits work to bring in a new me.

### wanting better clarity on masculinity

This week I had many questions on masculinity. The kind of man I should be, how I should behave. I really don’t like any of the stuff guys typically have to do, it feels very show off~y. It feels like so much work, yet it feels like without it I won’t be able to get noticed or be attractive as a man.

**I wrote this in my journal this week: all I want to know is that my heart and the way I love is sufficient.**

I do feel a calling that I need to forget everything about the past. Jesus didn’t come to us to patch up old traditions, but came to do a new thing. I feel more peace forgetting all the silky SD stuff and just letting God have the steering wheel on my development as a man.

I feel I’ve become timid. Afraid to try. Afraid to express. Afraid to step out because I think that will hurt me. I feel like I don’t know how to be a man.

On Friday we had a small spiritual gathering with a few friends, and I shared that my two goals are to be deeply affirmed in god, and to do things more in faith. Stepping out of my comfort zone and all that.

during the Friday session, sachini said something that I felt really spoke truth to me. She said she doesn’t like chasing. And I get that, it feels like you’re striving out of your own accord. And a lot of masculinity feels like that to me.

On Saturday, we had an amazing day watching the musical dear Evan Hansen and then having dinner followed by a long conversation by the Yarra. We spoke a lot about relationships, what we want in a partner, and so forth. We were there till 2am and that interaction really filled my heart. Honestly I feel just hearing good Christian godly woman talk about expectations is super helpful to me. Especially when sachini and Sandra said we don’t need too much, just for him to love god and loves (her). Just want to keep praying to god to teach me how to be a man, and whether I should keep waiting or step out in faith?
