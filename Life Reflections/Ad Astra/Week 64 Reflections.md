### Tough week in the office

This week was probably the toughest week in the office. Julia set an expectation for me to finish the canvas scrolling work by mid June or end of June latest. And I think that just drove a lot of stress for me. I haven’t had the best experience working in the canvas package, and I was super stressed out throughout the week about making progress. I was frustrated throughout the week and just very worried about the lack of progress and clarity,

I’m afraid of stress, I’m afraid of expectation. I want to surrender all this to god.

Sachini was f great support during this time, she counseled and supported me, she ministered to my soul. She prayed fervently over me.

### Meeting with avy

We had a frank discussion about boundaries, and it seems like my relationship with women is going to change. I thank god for sending me grace, for we have wise counsel.

I’m leaning toward reframing boundaries with all female friendships.and trusting that gods grace will be sufficient if I choose to honor him and honor the woman he has chosen for me,

### Prayer list

- a good chat with avy
- Good work outcomes and smooth sailing on the project, clarity.
