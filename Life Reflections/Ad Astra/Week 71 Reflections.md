### Tuesday

I feel down, overwhelmed and unmotivated.

I feel stressed that I have to see people like Julia today and put up a more presentable face.

I feel sad that I’m still here like this.

I feel very sad and down thinking about the meeting with Julia. Like it’s a heavyweight on my shoulders.

---

Realized that I subconciously try to cater to expectations of myself, or my assumptions of people’s expectations of me. My soul is never at rest. It’s like I’m always searching, but never finding. Lord, I want to find rest in my innermost being in you.

Lies?:

- There are problems in our relationship, I have to start discussions for them so we can work it all out.
- I have to open up a space for her to talk about her experiences with the disagreement. To make her feel like I care.
- I have to pour in emotionally for her and right now I’m not doing that.

### wednesday

I just felt very unworthy in my relationship, constantly doubting. Tonnes of negative thinking,

When beginning to write my role change form, I felt deeply inadequate and frustrated. I just feel so broken and unable to move forward with my health issues. And frustrated because people behind me have already moved forward. I just feel angry.

Listening to Andrew Chisholm and his message, with what little I have step forward in faith, like Gideon. And you’ll discover gods strengths within you. I tried to escape the Capabilities project, but yet I’m still on it. So I’ll go forward in faith god has a plan, even though I’m angry, I pray that god softens my heart, so I have a good attitude, and if I don’t get the promotion, I trust his ways even though I don’t understand.

I really love and want to thrive at what I do, but Lord my mind is not the same. My body is not the same. What is your will for me? I’m angry. This feels similar to the time last year when I felt like everyone else was going to be blessed and not me. That I was just destined to look at life from the other side of the glass. That God was a dictator and I’m forced to submit to his will. Lord I submit to your will, forgive my stubborn heart. Soften it God, so I may pray to you blameless.

### friday

I had a 2 hour meeting, one with the Editing API team for a retro, and than a close to an hour meeting with Vadim where he was going at a 100 miles per hour and I was struggling to keep up. And I felt super low and emotionally lethargic after. Later I spiraled and I was super cynical about everything in my life. Sachini then called me to build me back up. This is a season where I invite in God’s strength, Grace says:

> Thank you for sharing that so honestly.  
>   
> It takes courage to admit when we're at the end of our strength—but that's exactly where God begins.  
>   
> Your message reminded me of a powerful truth in 2 Corinthians 12:9:  
> "My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is made perfect in weakness."  
>   
> When you said you felt like you had nothing left to give, I thought, “That’s actually a holy place to be.” Because it’s in those moments that we’re invited to shift from striving to abiding.  
>   
> Jesus said in John 15:5:  
> "I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in Me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit—for apart from Me you can do nothing."  
>   
> You were never meant to carry the weight of relationships—or anything, really—on your own.  
>   
> God isn't asking you to pour from an empty cup. Instead, He invites you to come to Him first, let Him fill you up, and let His love overflow into your relationships.  
>   
> Matthew 11:28 is such a comfort in those times:  
> "Come to Me, all who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest."  
>   
> So, even in this season of weakness, don’t see it as failure—see it as a divine invitation.  
>   
> You're not falling apart; you’re being reminded of your need for God’s presence, not performance.  
>   
> I’m praying that this moment becomes a turning point—not where you work harder, but where you rest in Him deeper.  
>   
> God is with you, He’s for you, and He delights in you, even when you're empty.  
>   
> You don’t have to "do" to be loved—you just have to receive.  
>   
> Standing with you in this season of growth Johnny  
>

### sunday

I went to a bike shop earlier in the day, when dad asked me to go I was initially quite nervous to go, but I said yes. During which I was quite scared and really timid.

Afterwards Sachini came, she was here for 4 hours or so. Now as I write this at 5pm, I feel low, I feel tired and I feel lethargic. I feel bad that I get tired spending time with my partner. Why am I so tired? I feel confused/sad that this happens in the first place. Sachini is quite understanding, but I do worry how this will impact her.

As I write this, sadness, confusion, fatigue washes over me. I’m praying for God’s grace.

I feel scared that even time spent with my partner causes me to be this way. I was at the dinner table with mom earlier and she said are you okay, and I said I’m tired but I’m okay, but I forgot what she said but the feeling was that she wasn’t sure if it’s okay that I’m like this. How do I be with my gf without being tired?

Why do I feel like I’m still giving even tho I’m with her? Lord how do I be with the one you’ve given me?

she gave me the gift of the story of Samson, that even tho I turned my back on God, God never turned his back on me, that I am always to be called to gods purpose. For that reason she believes that a promotion is coming, and I will be in a position of influence.
