|[[Untitled 5]]|I had a dream where I was being delivered of things by Ken Fish. He got a lot of stuff out I remember vomiting like crazy and he even wiped my snot at some point. There was another guy there, it kind of looked like David Tan. I remember looking at him for so long I just couldn’t recognize him but looking back I think it’s him. This dream was so vivid.  <br>  <br>There were pastors there at some point (this might’ve happened before the deliverance). Some kinda different event. And there’s this guy who was telling a story, he had a strong angry outburst. The pastor said that’s fanna. In the dream i interepreted that as the evil spirit.  <br>  <br>I feel lighter after I woke up, so interesting.  <br>  <br>I remember Dave having a story to tell, it looked like he was really heavy. He didn’t want to tell it, just get a sense that he’s very troubled.  <br>  <br>I’m very spiritually sensitive, that’s why the 1st ayahuasca was so hard on me. But in general I have to watch the activities I take part in, the people I hang around.|November 12, 2024|DD-55|
|[[Untitled 6]]|I went to paulynns church, and she was trying to teach me something about body locks. Where she uses it to control a doll. Later on I see a Buddhist shrine, it was all very confusing, IDK why I saw a Buddhist shrine. Possibly the enemy trying to warn me off of going?|November 17, 2024|DD-56|
|[[Untitled 7]]|In a separate dream, Dave hearnden starts crying because Greg roodt is leaving, other engineers start crying too. Idk how to interpret this.|November 17, 2024|DD-57|

  
  

### Hosting LG study

It was honestly a daunting experience. In the lead up I kept thinking about it, unsure how to go about it and whether people are going to be receptive towards it. Etc etc, there was too much worrying and fixating. So I handed it to God and went into it with much less prep than j normally do, just before I was quite calm. And God really gave me what I needed to get it done. Afterwards Clement asked for my slides, I guess he found it useful. My meter is God, afterwards I had the dreams about paulynn and the Buddhist shrine. I'm not sure what God wants me to do next.

### A day out in the city

For the first time since semi recovery, I've decided to try going into the city to enjoy myself. It honestly alright, I got bored pretty quickly and the highlight was having a soft shell crab ramen.

I realize I looked at a lot of girls, and honestly was really confused about how I felt about talking to them. And whether I should, and what God wants for me. At the end of the day I'm insanely attracted to women, I feel that so strongly.

I was praying for God the whole time but I just felt like there was a disconnect, between my head and my heart. I wasn't at peace I wasn't feeling much of anything I was kinda a corpse and maybe tense.

Some random school kids tried to talk to me but I just did not care.

I think I'm just really confused on what God wants me to do. I feel very conflicted. God, what do you want my relationship with women to look like?

I woke up in the middle of the night and the word came to mind “you don’t have to prove your worth to people”.

It feels like whenever I think about CA/online dating it’s a lot of that. And I don’t know how to do it any other way. When have I ever just been normal and let it happen?

### Visiting paulynn’s church

Visiting paulynn’s church, afterwards I had a convo with Luke the pastor. And he affirmed to me that my mind will be redeemed in God. To use my mind for God’s purposes, and my relationship to it will be better? Something like that. As in the past I only used it for me, and it was never from the perspective of how do i want to use it to worship God. I guess a similar thing could be said about my relationships. Like Anna Philpot said, God will send people to affirm who I am. Luke said my cerebral brain is a gift, and God will use it so that I would preach the gospel to people in a way that only i know how.

I feel it's very true, Ive very much shied away from the thinking and the brain at the moment, cus of how bad it was in the past. But like the message today said, have a space where he is the goal through the gift he has given you.
