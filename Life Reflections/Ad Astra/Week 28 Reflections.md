> Had a dream last night that I was hanging out with Sachi and someone else. We were at some pond/pool playing and there were some crocodiles and stuff. Felt like it was God telling me to invest in my male relationships.

> Had a dream about gay sex? LMAO wth.

### Guy friendships

After the dream about sachi and co. above, the next day a group chat started with Aleks/Andrew/Danyon. Feels like God is prompting me to pursue my male friendships. And after reflection, a large majority of my friendships are female, especially ones in my inner circle.

### Daniel Johnsson

After wednesday’s workshop with Amy. I was sitting next to her and I just had the overwhelming conviction to tell her about BJJ, that it’d be good for Daniel. She seemed receptive to the idea. And after meeting him today where we sat together at the Sunday casey service. We seemed to connect on a few points and it was great to meet him. ANd I’ve tried my best to plant the seeds of BJJ and im just praying hard to God right now that he brings the increase. That he be the ones that grows the crop.

### Surrendering Justine

Couple days before Saturday. I started saying a prayer to God. Let me not act out in selfish ambition, but to honor you. Let me be single unless called upon by you.

### A night full of connection

Saturday night, justine was there. I was honestly acting pretty normal, we went to Glen, had dinner. And decided to get Froyo. We then went to the glen shopping center where I told my testimony.

Afterwards we sat outside the Glen and just had a really nice d&m sesh. During which she revealed that she’s having doubts of her bf. And we just went into a lot of our struggles and she opened up that she feels lonely and that’s why she’s in that relationship but she feels further away from God.

I went away from that night feeling quite elated/connected/switched on. I’m not sure why. It feels like we really connected.

At night, I struggled to sleep, and felt like two forces were fighting within me. One side kept jumping ahead of itself and setting expectations for what this means. The other quelled it and surrendered it to God, praying not to act out of selfish ambition, but to commit to a life of singleness unless called upon by him.

I ended the night with a resounding prayer: God, if it is your will and she is the one. I will build our family in your name, and I will give my life up for her.
