### Conversation with Avy

Finally got the chance to talk with Avy today. Told her about the relationship and had an honest talk about what she felt. She felt like I told her too late, and she cried because she felt so conflicted on whether or not to give me space. I felt really bad for being so absent from our friendship, and tbh I felt like I was afraid of people who weren’t immediately in my social circle. God, you have put these people in my life, help me to honor them.

Now we’re on a better footing.

### Sachini’s apology

So good that god convicted her for the apology, it was an apology that I didn’t know that I needed. If she hadn’t apologize I wouldn’t have realized how devalued I felt, and that would’ve just sat on my soul.

### Melissa’s message

Out of the blue, she texts me. Asking what I meant by saying the full weight of what she said being made clear. This immediately creates conflict in me cus my first instinct is to delete it, but I knew I needed to share it with her, but I also didn’t want her to not believe me when I said I didnt message her back. this made me really nervous to talk to Sachini about it, because I didn’t want to upset her. And what are the chances that the week we struggle with this, was the week Melissa messages me out of the blue.

We had a good chat about it in the car, and she heard me out and it was no issues in the end. We’re learning to get on the same page for this.
