### Surrendering Lust to God

I woke up in the middle of the night feeling I have to do this.

### Chat with Julia

I had a catchup with Julia about my rolechange, and it was hard because even tho I was close, I wasn’t quite there just yet. And also the feedback from Xidorn saying he wasn’t sure if i was ready yet also made me quite sad. Because I feel limited by what my brain is capable of doing.

### learning about the accuser

Watched a Mike Conell sermon earlier, and the accuser says this is your fault. You are the reason you are not acceptable and good enough. I have lived this lie for such a long time.

### Mental challenges

Had a older patty on Wednesday for lunch, thursday / friday onwards was just quite tough.

Felt like i couldn’t concentrate, I was getting stressed out and worked up by the little things. I felt like i got stuck in a trauma loop again, where I start to doubt everything . I feel flushed with fear.[ I can’t get things out of my mind. I don’t breath the same way, my body feels different physically. I felt there was something depressing my spirit. Felt incapable of feeling joy.

### Live wire park

Honestly I almost didn’t come, and I’m so glad I did. Because I had so much fun. I was placing a limiting belief on myself that I couldn’t do it, but my body ended up able to take it. Praise God. I want to do more of these things.

There were times where I felt like just an outsider, but I think it’s just the enemy attacking me. I don’t want to feel like someone who’s always on the outside looking in.

### Justine

I think during live wire park i kept suppressing myself because i felt so inadequate and insufficient, this spirit of fear/inadequacy just overtakes me. Position, posture and purpose. I humble myself to let God work through me.

### Chris Yong’s message

Chris Yong’s message really struck me today, step outside of your comfort zone as an act of faith. That’s why I created the FaithDB.
