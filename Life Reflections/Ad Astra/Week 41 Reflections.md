### Editor cop duty

Compared to last time I had to do this 6 months ago, my mental health is seriously leaps better. I remember the last time I did this I barely got through the day, my slack was just too much.

### Spiritual struggles / doubting God

Just was not sure if god was working in my life. I struggled pretty hard this week, I was doubting god a lot because I wasn’t sure if he was working. I still was not fully recovered mentally and my relationship situation definitely wasn’t any better. I just felt like a bad Christian, it probably started cus I prayed to god on Monday to test me. I also had many dreams lately about relationships and was also exceptionally horny this week. Felt like god was just leaving me to burn.

I don’t know where my mind is for that, but right now I pray that I see god working in other areas, and he is. He has blessed me with work. And I’m potentially seeing that he always knew that i was more creative than that and I should pursue it more. God really knows me the best, he started planting that seed 4 years ago.

### lifegroup Christmas lunch

I don’t know what is happening, after last night I just feel so drained. I was a bit too excited maybe for certain things, I’m not really sure if this is supposed to be happening. Am I not allowed to be excited anymore? Not sure how I’m gonna make it through the lunch honestly.

Feel a bit deflated low key. Not sure why this is still happening to me.

After the event, I feel tonnes better. At the beginning I was a bit low energy. I thought that I might need to leave soon. And then afterwards we played a really high energy exciting card games. and I feel fine after. Looking back, and coupling that with the healthy masculinity dream I had, I think the difference is in using my excitement to do what. Am I genuinely excited? Or am I using it to maintain some kind of image?
