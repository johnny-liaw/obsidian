### health

This week there were some struggles with health, and I got a call from my gp saying I need to book a follow up for my blood test. They must’ve found something in it that needs discussing. I’m hopeful it’s something we can action on like low blood sugar or something, I been feeling low this week and it affects me. This is part of the challenge. Where sometimes I’d feel so fatigued especially after exercise, and then struggle massively with mood issue afterwards. I’m hoping it’s something to do with blood sugar or related. There were a few days later in the week that I struggled, especially dinner after church on Saturday.

### coaching

I think the internal coaches finally got back to me, I signed up when I was first having mental issues last year. I was initially hesitant because I’d be stepping outside of my comfort zone, but speaking to Sachini afterwards, I think I’m going to go for it. I feel like when I prayed about it too, I ad a peace about it.

### forgiveness

I was praying for forgiveness for dad, mom, Ellie and Adam. I want to no longer be carrying these things. In Jesus name I forgive you.

### The power of a praying husband

I’ve been praying to god that I may come to him with a blameless heart. Without bitterness, resentment, irritability and unforgiveness. I submit myself to god, so I may be an instrument of deliverance for my wife. And I pray that I can be the man, the husband and the leader he called me to be.

### one year in Christ

life changes so much in a year. This time last year, life didn’t feel like it was worth living. Now, work is better. Health is better, and I have a partner that I know I’m going to marry. All these things felt completely out of reach and not possible, God is good. What a story, what a comeback. Father, let my life be a story of your glory, and to boast in your name. I surrender myself, so that you may be the wind in my sails to take me where you want me to be.
