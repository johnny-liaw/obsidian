### turmoil around Sachini

Throughout the week I felt very strong emotions around her. I prayed for my heart not to run before my head, which it was already doing. I was battling myself most of the week, my desires were very strong.

On Wednesday/thursday, several voice notes came through from her which were kinda earth shattering. She mentioned the soul/spirit connection that we had. She also said she’d be honoured to have me as the man to teach her girls whom they should be seeking. And she later on said she’d wants to lead, and she’d want to do it with me.

The turmoil was pretty intense, on the flight to Singapore I was wrestling with it the entire time. Why did she end the voice notes early? Are my chances gone? Did I do something wrong? I feel like the path forward is not blessed.

I spoke to Grace and she prayed for me, and says God says it’s not right now to be starting a relationship because im still healing. So my directive is clear. And she mentioned that my heart is broken from last relationships so I’ve been praying into that. I really felt so much sorrow the past 3 days since arriving in Malaysia. The isolation and the lack of the lack of things to do generally makes the time more pronounced, so all I had was to seek God and I really found comfort in it.

I think one thing that really troubled me was she seemed way too non chalant, undeserving for something more. I don’t know how she thinks so it’s really hard to say. But I would’ve thought that given what we went through and the things she said, there’d be more from her.

I spoke to Sandra and somethings have become clearer:

- Justine and I never really worked. Outside of the attraction do I even want to be friends with her? Yes but I’m not drawn to her even as a friend like I am with Sandra and sachini. God was right. Grace was right. I’m so glad that didn’t hapen.
- Christian dating is different. I wanted it to progress immediately or I wanted feedback.
- I was being impatient.
- I can treat leading with her as enjoying getting to know her better.
- I need to have more faith in gods plan for me, what’s given to me will make its way to me.

  

so overall, I still have lack of peace whenever I try to think about what her position is. But I’m going to pray for more of god and less of me. It’s hard pill to swallow to deny my nature but I’m trusting god to lead me through this, my directive right now is clear and I should focus on leading this group.

### Pride in church

After church I complained that the service was too long, that was pride. I repent for this, god has affirmed me but that doesn’t mean that I should start trusting in myself.

### one year

It’s been a year since I’ve moved back, wow. Seems surreal, when I came back everything seemed impossible. Praise God, glory goes to you.
