This week was one of the more normal ones I’ve had in awhile, energetically and mental health wise. This week I felt like I was forced to face my inner brokenness.

On Friday, not too sure what happened but after I ate lunch, I started feeling very low. Just before my meeting with Xidorn I started feeling very anxious, and during the meeting at various points it felt like I couldn’t calm down. It was honestly pretty scary, Xidorn was saying words but I wasn’t understanding any of it. It could be connected to the fact that mom was leaving for Epic camp for the weekend.

Afterwards in the evening it was similar, just felt like there was a baseline rumbling of anxiety. I don’t know how I arrived at this in the end but I was forced to reckon with my own brokenness.

I am deeply broken underneath. I’m petrified of not being enough and not being lovable. And I’ve tried everything under the sun to ‘fix’ it, to ‘earn’ it, to deny it and even hide it. I had to accept that it’s okay I’m broken, and I shouldn’t hide away from it anymore.

The next morning I woke up, and replied to everyone that I’ve been avoiding replying to. And was just really honest that I’d been hiding for far too long with my brokenness. Annette has since replied and was very supportive 💌

I feel throughout the past few weeks I was slowly fed thoughts that led to where I am now. I had a thought earlier in the week that my fantasizing might be linked to trying to escape, or something might be up.

And sure enough connecting it to the revelation I had last night, it’s how I comfort myself. I spent the day meditating on the word, and praying about it. And I felt more relaxed that I’ve felt in a very long time.

Afterwards I went to church, then dinner, then dessert. It was honestly the most energetic/normal I’ve been in a really long time. I was able to interact/laugh like I haven’t done so in honestly 3-4 months. it’s great to learn the skill of mixing in excited conversation, as well as more low key chilled conversation. But after a bit it did feel a bit too much and my energy was starting to wane, so I called it a night and went home early.

During the weekend I felt my primary prayer was “Father, I surrender to you my brokenness”.

For too long I’ve tried to fill it with things of the world and my will, none have come to fruition. It is God’s will that truely bares fruit.

Sunday was a day where I dedicated a solid chunk of the day to phone + laptop being turned off. I slept, journaled and read the bible. I came to the realization (after some reflecting on my EAP with Scott) that I had a lot of bad mindsets when it came to emotional intimacy.

### Ways I use relationships to hide my brokenness

- trying to impress rather than connect
- trying to be loud + overcompensating rather than being authentic and gentle hearted.
- Using physical intimacy for the act of love but not the feeling of it. A distraction really.
- Validation. If they like me, I tend to lose interest quickly.
- If it’s not someone that can offer me validation, I generally don’t pay them much attention.
- Prematurely seeing if something has potential or fantasizing about a future with them.
- Self sabotating by thinking of reasons why that person is not a good fit.
- EuiYoung: ending it early bc you were afraid she’ll eventually see your imperfections.
- Avoiding dating altogether. And instead distracted myself with self improvement.

  

Despite all my imperfections, I see that I really just am a human being, who desires true emotional intimacy. To be truly seen and to truly see someone else. And I’m willing to work on my imperfections.

  

I feel God also dropped another word in my heart: **this is a season where I learn how to be an introvert.**

I think I’ve harbored ill feels towards being an introvert, I thought men had to be brash, tough, extroverted in order to be worthy. But now that I think of it it seems so silly, but that mindset was so ingrained into me it was never even something I could consciously question. So the question is, how do I be an introvert? I think about Chris, Chenchen, can I speak as little as they do in LG/church/dinner?

  

So that brings a further question, who did God create me to be?

- I’m an introvert.
- I’ve got a soft heart.
- I value true, deep emotional intimacy.

  

Oh and another thought, just before as I started typing this. I felt horrible on the sofa. Possibly because introverted time makes me confront myself, and that makes me really uncomfortable. It’s much easier to stay distracted and push the feelings down.
