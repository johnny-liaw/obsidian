### Dating apps

After last week’s dating talks, I decided to download CMB. Started talking to random people like Veni + Steph. Steph is still kinda on and off going. I realized that sometimes I need feedback on how things are going. I think her reply speeds/frequency say everything that needs to be said.

There was a day where after not hearing back from Steph for more than 24hrs, I decided to download Hinge.

I just feel terrible using these apps honestly, it’s like quenching a thirst with salt water. I feel further than God than ever. I don’t think he’s blessing this way. I don’t know what his plan is for me. Doing things my way doesn’t work. God, how do I date your way?

The thing about dating apps is that I just feel so anxious/heighted/unpeaceful after using it. Feels like such an unsatisfying way to talk to someone. I want to get to know them and we’re talking but I’m not actually getting to know them.

Also the low feedback, you’re constantly wondering how am I doing, and it drives me nuts. At least in person when you’re interacting with someone, you can gauge a lot more quickly. Also when you’re online dating you feel the need to be perfect, that self comparison game is strong.

The moment I deleted the apps, God started giving me dreams.

### Gut issues

I don’t know what’s happening but since the dating apps, my gut has been flaring up. Im at the stage where food isn’t appetizing. I feel bloated after I eat. I even had to go home early after Vicky’s bday party which made me sad.

### Overall

Overall, I feel quite far apart from God atm. I need to draw closer to God. i don’t really know what life is.
