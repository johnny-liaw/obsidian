|[[Untitled 4]]|It was a larger dream but I don’t really remember it, only glimpses of this one. I was with my sister, and there were these two other girls as well. When I woke up I didn’t know who they were but in the dream I definitely knew them. They text me and they said “are you okay?”Something about my mental health. And I was like how do you know that? There’s no possible way for you to know that.  <br>  <br>And then I remember being prayed for by someone, I’m not sure who but I remember Erica was part of the dream as well. I don’t think she was the one praying for me though.  <br>  <br>Wnile being prayed for, I just remember fighting the prayer. I kept wanting to get up out of it but I felt like a spell that was holding me under, which was confusing. It’s almost as if I didn’t know which side to pick.|November 9, 2024|DD-54|
|[[Untitled 3]]|I was at uni with Aryan and a bunch of other people I don't recognize. And there was a problem festering in the background, I think it was about a girl. And whenever it would get brought up I would just freeze. To the point where Aryan is like what bothers you so much about it? And I said it's because I'm so scared. I remember the uni had classes where you could sign up for stuff and I signed up for photography. I remember Aryan and I talking at another point and I said I didn't do anything majorly wrong, and he had this look on my face and he said you didn't do anything wrong at all.|November 4, 2024|DD-53|

  
  

### The dream with Aryan

Sunday night I was feeling off and I remember I just prayed to God “help me overcome this”. Which I think is a fairly new prayer because I usually pray for God for healing or to take it away.

That very night God gave me the dream with Aryan. I was able to interpret this when I woke up in the middle of the night, Aryan was my guardian angel to get me to where I am, and he has delivered me another message.

Just felt the sense that I'm too ruled by fear at the moment, fear of not meeting expectations? I don't really know how to use what I've been given.

### Midnight idea

This idea came to mind in the middle of the night, should I look into it? Usually things in the middle of the night to me when I need to look more closely at it.
