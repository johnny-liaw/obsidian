### Monday

On Monday, I felt like I was back in 2024. I couldn’t really read what was on screen, I had to coax myself somehow to get back to some kind of a normal routine. I was still nowhere near where I was.

But God sent an engineer called Maurice to do a bunch of PRs for me, that really made it easier.

Sachini came over that night, we talked, and when I mentioned space she cried again. I once again dug into reserves I did not have to support her.

### Tuesday

I saw Scott today, and realized how far I have drifted from my own recovery journey. I have a lot of work to do.

At night I needed to be with mom and she prayed a bunch of prayers over me. I slept with Toby because I could not be alone.

### Wednesday

Was not a good work day, I was not particularly capable. I was mostly worried about the conversation with Sachini later tonight. What is a ‘be there for me’ often turns out for I be there for her.

She told me about the kindness of God, how God has sent her multiple people like Clement, Meeya, and another colleague that affirmed to her that her role is just be there for me in faith. Afterwards, I dove into what I needed from her. And she started crying inconsolably. Did not even want me to touch her. She then started saying things like, what is the point of all this, I’ll just run to mom and not you. I don’t feel like I can depend on you, I miss my single season. Of which the last part I had this absolute look of disgust on my face when she said it, and then she quickly tried to correct. But later cries harder because she was scared. And then I’m made to feel doubly bad.

She admitted that she shouldn’t have said those things. I learnt that when she says I can’t depend on you, she really wants to know that she can depend on my heart.

I feel like we’ve learnt a bit about each other, but made no progress towards what actually needs to be done. Which is how to support me during this time.

I actually don’t know how to communicate with her during this time. I feel it’s stressful for me, and not relaxing.

I admit, there’s bitterness, anger. There’s so much negativity said to me during this time. And not getting my needs met. And feeling just absolutely gaslit.

Feels like overall she gets her needs met but my critical needs aren’t.

### Thursday

Woke up a time or two very anxious, and very little left in the reserve. I made a decision that I was not going to go to work for two days. Felt like in the middle of the night a lot of things were being downloaded into my brain, like a wellbeing scale, wellbeing plan, and so forth.

Spent most of the day with mom, during which she called Amy. And they thought the best thing for me to do is get better, and for them not to get involved. At the end of the day it’s a decision between her and I, on what to do in our relationship as we are our adults. I feel my boundaries are being crossed, and I’ve allowed them to be crossed.

But I want to see her the way God sees her. To let go of the disappointment, the hurt, everything. And focus on myself, because that is the best thing I can do for us. And trust God to take care of you. To be there for you, even when I can’t. And if you decide this relationship is no longer what you want, I accept your decision. For all things work out for good for those who love God.

> the relationship is not at risk if the feelings are genuine

> Give her grace for not understanding, and disappointing and hurting you. To see her the way God sees her.

> God can take better care of you, far better than I can.

- **Message to SG**
    
    My Love, thank you for always offering me a listening ear and your support, you truly are a Proverbs 31 woman. I seriously can’t thank God enough for a partner like you, your grace, your patience and your character have just amazed me. I know our relationship is going through a lot of changes at the moment, most of which aren’t pleasant. I also can’t imagine the stress/uncertainty this puts on you, and I’m so sorry you have to go through this. It really really breaks my heart to see you in this much pain. But I firmly believe Romans 8:28 “And we know that all things work together for good to those that love God”. All things - includes you too babe! (And me, and us of course).
    
    Right now as we stand, my mental health really is bottom of the barrel. My family is scrambling to get me healthy again. For me that means devoting 100% of my energy to doing what my psychologist says, which is starting with lots of rest and unplugging. So I’m gonna be distant till the end of the week as I give my mind some time, things are extremely overwhelming at the moment. I’ll send through a couple texts here and there to let you know I’m okay, but I’ll be mostly offline from devices to give myself space. Let’s checkin with each other at the end of the week? Though my mind/body is 0/7, my heart for you has not changed. A relationship is only at risk when either parties feelings have changed, our feelings hasn’t, you’ve got absolutely nothing to worry about. This is our relationship is going through a maturation process as we go through life’s curveballs. I’m choosing to focus on me, so I can get healthy. So I can come back to my baby.
    
    All this is temporary, we’ll find a way to get healthy, no matter what the journey looks like. Like Ecclesiastes says, there’s a season for everything, and this too, is just a season.
    
    I know this is an overwhelming season for you too, please look after yourself. I’ve fully surrendered this relationship over to God, for Him to take care of you. Seek support babe, talk to Grace if you’re comfortable. This is only the beginning of our story.
    

### Rest of the week

It was just an absolute nightmare. Thursday was terrible. Because I told SG i needed space. That led to a big disagreement and I felt like everything was just too much. Thought I was going to lose my job and thought i was going to lose her. My whole life was just imploding in front of my eyes. Woke up in the middle of night early friday morning just not being able to sleep. Only could go to sleep when mom prayed in tongues over me.

Friday morning was a blur, felt like i was thrown back to 2024.

I wrote her a letter [[A letter to my special one]] to explain everything that happened, she apologized on Saturday.

Saturday was a better day cus I went for a ride. and sunday we called and are on a healing journey together.

This week was just the worst of the worst. I would like to be on a path of recovery.
