### Steph from cmb

[[Msg to Steph]]

On Monday, I got a msg back from her agreeing lets call. but honestly I was so conflicted/unpeaceful. I spent a long time fighting myself and finally felt like I should just trust what God has for me and end it with her. To be obedient in this time of waiting to receive what he has for me. After doing that I had a lot more peace, and I started dreaming again. As opposed to last week where I wasn’t dreaming at all because of my disobedience.

### Mental health struggles

This week was also quite tough for mental health, just the cobwebs from the gut issues, the mood swings were quite strong and on Wednesday after some deep encouragement from dad went to LG, and felt better after. Sometimes I’m just really out of it. And right now on Sunday as I type this, feeling a lot better than I had earlier.

My prayer this week has been for the Lord to grant me the strength, hope, faith and patience to carry through this period.

This week was also the week where I realized the Bao’s heating up represent the furnace.

### Orbis #1 [[Orbis #1]]

Also had prayer ministry this week, it was really good. We went through a lot and i was super hesitant to mention the dating coach thing but I’m glad I spat it out and confided in them. Anna said there’s a great annointing in me, and I really believe that. My dreams this week I’ve just been trying to figure out what the keys mean.

### Intimate Saturday dinner

When I saw Caleb and Paulynn holding hands at church, I felt angry. I was comparing and didn’t feel like my anointing or blessings have shown. It was a spiritual battle at church. Afterwards I wasn’t feeling great and almost left. But it was a small dinner group so I thought i should go.

The night was honestly great, I much prefer smaller groups, got to have a lot of deep chats with Justine/Sandra.

At times I felt like I was exalting myself and my pride, particularly when I told Justine that I’d been praying for her. And the word of knowledge. and also the sharing of the doc I had. Humility is seeing yourself the way God sees you, this is how God made me, so would I want to hide these parts of myself?

I feel quite confused about Justine, I don’t really know what to think of her anymore at this stage. God speak to me. Esp given she just broke up with her boyfriend.

Also I thought I was going to crash hard and go home, but somehow stuck through it and I feel fine? First time I’ve actually ridden through the wave and come out on the other side.

What I liked about last night was that I really didn’t rush. I came back to God and gave it to him (w.r.t. Justine).

Sandra said my strengths is my intuition around people.

Justine said leadership is in my calling.
