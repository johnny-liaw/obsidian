### Struggles with fatigue / emotional exhaustion

On Monday, I started feeling a deep sense of fatigue. Not a physical one but an emotional one. A sense that I just had nothing to give. It was scary, and it still is as I write this on Thursday.

After BJJ on Monday, I just felt a very deep sense of burden. I felt like I had nothing to give. Nothing to give to the relationship. I felt a constant burden. Wanting to give but unable to. Unable to extrude emotions or afraid to. Afraid that I would over exert myself. Thereâ€™s a sense of emotional deadness in me. **And it scares me so much.**

I feel bad that I canâ€™t give to my relationship with Sachini. Or maybe Iâ€™m giving myself a burden I canâ€™t bare. She tells me that itâ€™s God that holds us together. I have to constantly remind myself of that too, I want to partner with the Holy Spirit on this. Not gain nuggets of truth and run off into the samurai sunset on a solo mission. Sachini says she feels God is going to flood my mind with something new, in a way that it almost dissipates or drowns out the fear that I feel within. Thinking of it, it actually makes a lot of sense. A lot of my old ways of thinking were drowned out in the suffering season, something in my brain just changed very dramatically.

Sometimes itâ€™s frustrating, feeling this way. It feels like youâ€™re mind is under siege and you feel like youâ€™re afraid to express, constantly timid. Just have to trust the process and go with what God has for me.

One thing I appreciate so much about her is that she says we will take it one day at a time, and if by Friday Iâ€™m not feeling like it, thatâ€™s totally okay. In general sheâ€™s been nothing short of a saving grace. God really gave me the best woman I didnâ€™t even have the words to ask for.

### Our money

On Wednesday night we had a moment where we were at Maccas after LG. And I admitted to her that when I spend money nowadays, I donâ€™t just think Iâ€™m spending my money, but Iâ€™m spending our money. And she admitted that she started doing the same too, even without my prompting. Itâ€™s just crazy how aligned we are sometimes. And how steadfast we are moving in the same direction. Really praise God. I wouldnâ€™t remotely have had the wisdom to ask for the woman that she is, God knows, and God provided.

### Friday

I feel like I woke up feeling okay. And then Toby came in and he was just not the same, when he jumped on the bed he started yelping and crying really badly. And I think that stressful situation just sent me over the edge into self protection mode. And now as I write this itâ€™s lunch time, and I feel like Iâ€™m just not the same. I donâ€™t feel normal, Iâ€™m a lot more protection focused, timid, fearful, unwilling to step out in strength, in fear of what might happen. I just feel absolutely terrible.

I start to remember the days last year where I felt like I wasnâ€™t even allowed to feel/have my own desires. And the days I just crash, the days I would get overwhelmed and Iâ€™d land on a spiral. And I wonder if the same thing is still going to happen. I get agitated at things that send me over the edge, or feel that they disrupt my garden. I think about the things Iâ€™d have to do in the future, my family, raising kids, fires that will go up. And I worry if Iâ€™d be adequate to handle those things. Iâ€™m just afraid of being sent over the edge. I feel like Iâ€™m already on the edge, since Monday.

### Friday date night

I wasnâ€™t feeling particularly great, so I biked to Jells park and back in under 2 hours, it was about 30kms. I felt a lot better after, had a simple dinner of chicken and went off to Sachiniâ€™s. At hers we just chilled on the couch, talking, reading the bible together and watching videos of japan travels.

I confided how afraid I feel sometimes in doing too much, so I suppress myself emotionally and all that. And she said she really wants me to be able to express myself fully ðŸ’•

Some things that stood out during our bible study:

- All things are the Lordâ€™s, we merely inherit it.
- Jehoshaphat did not know what to do, but he set his eyes on the Lord.
- They trusted God in the end, did not have to fight, and plundered more than they could carry away.

I remember sitting on the couch, watching japan travel videos with her on this onsen from Kurokawa, and she was just in awe at what sheâ€™s seeing. Sheâ€™s holding on to my arm, and she kept at it when her dad came to check on us. That was a really sweet moment.

We later had Red Rooster, and talking in the car with her, I admitted that I felt we were going to be a quick turnaround, and she admitted the same too.

In the car chatting with her, we were talking about how people meet nowadays, and what online dating is like. And I just got the sense that Godâ€™s story for our relationship was just incredible. Itâ€™s so rare to meet people organically, and have ours blossom in the way that it did. I love our story more and more now.

### Sunday date day

Picked up my glasses in the morning at Chadstone, then bought some instant ramen noodles. Then had a chill lunch with Sachini steaming dim sums and eating instant ramen noodles. Then proceeded to laze around on the couch watching youtube videos and went to the park near the hill and sat there for awhile. During which we got into a conversation about recapping the month, which I really liked. I love how weâ€™re both on the same page on a lot of things. Thereâ€™s still an immense of fear of stepping over the line though, fear of feeling â€˜weirdâ€™. Right now as I write this on Sunday I feel a sense of fear and weirdness that I just canâ€™t explain. I feel like I could crash any minute and it scares the crap out of me.

But during our talk she said when I took some time for me, how it felt to her like I was shutting her out, or trigger some past insecurities. Her ex used to shut her out when he would help the ex-gf move, heâ€™d also text his ex and still kept the same nickname from when they were dating in the past. So me going off-grid does make her nervous because it triggers that.

**Something interesting she also said: our souls are meant to come to rest.**
