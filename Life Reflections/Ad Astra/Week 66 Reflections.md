### lust and closing doors

This week I struggled greatly with lust, waking up and just thinking unholy thoughts. And overall just felt super far apart from god. Eventually had a frank discussion with Sachini and we agreed that we opened doors by laying together. After we spoke about it and consecrated ourselves, those feelings went away and I started dreaming again.

### forgiveness

This weekend the sermon was quite great, it was on forgiveness. And I realized Iâ€™ve been carrying too much unforgiveness.

### prayer list

- show me who to forgive and how.
