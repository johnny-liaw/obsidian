> I had a dream that my sister and I were on a train. A shinkansen type of train. Toby was with us. During one of the stops, it started with H something, my sister let Toby off the train and the train sped off. Afterwards I just remember being so distraught and and stressed out that later in the dream, I was doing something and I just could not keep it together. I think God was telling me in this dream that the way I approach things is not sustainable, it’s never been my plan that’s executed but God’s.

> Had a dream that I cummed, and afterwards I was sort of in a black prison where I couldn’t wake myself up. Feel like God is telling me that through desires the devil enters us. Curb your desires.

> I had another dream, this time it was Yulmin. I don’t remember the specifics of it but we were in a house, and I was mesmerized by her korean/english NIV bible. And I thought it was really cool. The korean text were on this black paper in between the white pages that had english. Why do I keep seeing these girls in my dreams?

> Had a dream that this time I was with a random group of friends, only person I remember in the midst was Chris Wong. We were at some staircase and he CW starts doing drugs. He strips naked and starts banging on this door to someone’s apartment right next to him. The dream seems chaotic but I vaguely remember some other girl being into me there but I don’t think I was that interested. At the end of the dream it was me lying about something to some drug boss, and then taking the slides all the way down to the bottom. But to get out I need to be searched by them or something and to get up I need an access code which I don’t have, so I was stuck. The dream ends there. Is it telling me that I need to face something?

> I had another dream where I was sort of met by the presence of something holy. I immediately bow down and I remember being moved/lifted? Something like that. And the feeling that accompanied it was just nothing I’ve ever felt before. It was just great.

> Had another dream where I only remember the end of it, I had a choice. Follow God’s way and be judged for it, and I did. Some plate object was broken on top of my head because of it.

### Curbing desires

After dream #2 about desires, I’ve been really praying about my desires this week. Asking God to help me curb it, and help me make every thought and desire obedient to Christ. There are 4 things we fight in this world:

1. attractions of the world
2. desires of the flesh
3. satan
4. death

Like today’s youversion daily scripture said, deny your natural self and trust that God will take care of it. Jesus says to deny yourself and take up your cross daily.

### Stress from work

This week was kind of a hellfire for work too. On weds/thurs I had a freakout when I felt some crushing pressure that I needed to get Doctopus done. My parents had to coax me back to work by saying just focus on today, let God take care of the rest. I remember going to lifegroup and I could feel this weight on me that I just can’t shake, and there’s nothing you can do about it. I felt like Doctopus is going to require me to do something/pull a miracle in a way that I just couldn’t do. I was not confident in my mental health and my body’s ability to do it.

And honestly it never ended up nearly as bad as I thought, I just put too much pressure on myself. This is one of my problems. After the experience I oddly feel better at day to day stuff? It’s kind of weird, it’s like being exposed to stress helps me deal better with stress.

### Justine

Saturday night was an interesting one. Turns out Justine came and I think I got way too excited about it, felt like I leaned towards the end of selling myself. Not as much as I have before but definitely more than I wanted to. It’s clear I haven’t fully surrendered this part of myself to God. But turns out she has a boyfriend, which was kind of a shattering moment. I guess I had expectations? That night I went to bed just sad, gruelling, questioning everything about my life and how nothing seems to be happening in it. The emptiness felt so profound that I can feel it physically, this gaping hole that starts at my chest and works its way down to my stomach. it was honestly a lot of self pity. I was doubting God a lot.

> I had another dream, this time I was speaking to someone holy and I said something like “she’s not the one for me, is she?” And I was met with the same holy surge of some kind. I took that as a confirmation from God that she isn’t the one.

  

Coming off of that it was honestly a lot of soul searching, I couldn’t understand why I saw her in a dream all those nights ago, maybe God was telling me of the people I had too much expectations for? I put expectations on people just as much as I on myself.

  

### My weaknesses

Following on from what happened with Justine + the work stuff that happened earlier in the week, I listed down a few of my biggest weaknesses:

1. Can be easily blinded by emotions.
2. Putting unnecessary/unrealistic expectations on myself/situations.
3. Often very hard on myself.
4. Default to worst case scenario.
5. Often not a good judge of myself, both good and bad.

Your weaknesses make you usable, your strengths make you a tool.

### Trust God to lead me out of the desert

Right now I’m not really sure what’s happening with my life. I yearn for something that I think is deep intimate connection, but I feel like it’s always unsatisfied. Life is unsatisfying in general. I feel empty a lot. Sometimes I just stick to my routine and I’m afraid of doing anything outside of it, because of how it’s impacted my health/mental health in the past.

I’m definitely a lot better in the past 2-3 weeks than I’ve been in a very very long time. I even watched 2 more high adrenaline movies this weekend (A quiet play day one + mad max furiosa) and I felt fine after. Part of me is still very reserved to go out of my comfort zone and do more things, for fear of it impacting my mental health and how I feel.

There’s definitely a part of me that hasn’t really yet surrendered it God and allowing him to lead me out of the desert. I was journaling about this before and that’s because when it was the worst of the worst for many many multiple months, it felt like i was left on my own to deal with it. God took care of some things like making sure I had a good manager, supportive network, etc. But I really felt like I suffered so much on my own… Holy spirit tell me if that’s not true. I also read today the scripture `It is not by pure strength that you perservered`. So it’s entirely possible that God carried me through that, I just felt very alone in that experience to deal with it. I would like to encounter him and speak to him about this tonight.
