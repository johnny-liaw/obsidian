### adventures with sachini

Mostly a week off enjoying time with her. On Tuesday I planned a beach day, and Thursday we went to Warburton. It was tough at times and I tended to fade later in the afternoon, but I’m glad i faced the days with no fear of crashing.

### Racquel catch up

She mentioned pre engagement counselling.

### struggles with lust

In the morning when I wake up, I struggle with lust. I feel like I should let her know. It’s unglamorous to talk about.

### prayer list

- lust
- Life group leading
- Resentment towards Ellie
