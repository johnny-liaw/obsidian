### spiritual testing

This week was a really hard week of spiritual testing.

I had a more stressful couple of days because of the adder work and wanting to get it out before Christmas. And on Friday just felt really weird, tense, stiff, uncomfortable. And it started a whole process of doubting what God is doing. I felt super frustrated and I was battling myself trying to force myself into thinking positive things. And Sandra said God made us as emotional beings and encouraged me to be open about how I feel and talk to God about it. And boy did I have a lot to say.

I ranted on how God took everything away from me. My friend , life in Sydney, any sense of well being and quality of life. My ability to feel excitement, to express myself. My masculinity and my ability to express that. God has brought me back to put me in a hole and he’s continued to leave me there. When I asked for guidance I feel he leaves me hanging, which makes me even more mad and disappointed.

Made me realise my hope in God was tied to fulfilling promises.

Sandra had been a God send, encouraging me that serving god is about who he is and not expecting anything in return.

So right now I’m in the mentality of I’ll serve God, but idk if he does things for my own good. A sort of assumption that I’m left out of his blessings.
