> I had a dream yesterday, it was with Jess. I wanted to do something on her phone, and it required accessing the photos app. So I gave it to her in case there’s anything in there that I don’t want her to see. She hands it back to me saying she already cleared, she makes it a habit to clear things. Looking back now it seems like nothing, but in the dream it felt like she’s made it a habit to hide things. This was bit of a telltale that Jess wasn’t all that she was. During the night I kept wrestling with the thought of whether I pursued her when I did because she was unavailable and somewhat distant at times?

> I had another dream, this time with Kat. We were on a date and honestly just having a great time. I don’t know why I’m having these dreams. Felt like in the dream it was said that it was a great time for me cus she was just being herself.

> There was a dream about Justine, again.  
> We were at some university, it was late at night. There was some dish washng business. And then I had to go. She awlked me to the front of the uni, i distinctly rmb looking at messenger and lucy texting me.  
> And then we were walking around and there was this bar and she turned briefly into this disney princess vibe like thing. But I was so concerned about trying to get to the pickup location in time. And then I ran into Shine + Emma, and Shine called me Salmon Back. I’m not sure where that name came from.

> I had a dream where Chris Wong and I were arguing about something. Feels like a stand for who I am.

### Loving relationships

One of the nights, I woke up in the middle of the night struggling massively with lust. And it came to me that I don’t know what a loving relationship looks like. Which is very true. Large majority of my relationships have been me using them as a means to fill the brokenness within.

### The struggle with singleness

There was a night, where I struggled massively with being single. I prayed to God to please send someone. And that I admitted I had trouble surrendering my singleness to him, because if i did and nothing happened, it would destroy my faith in him. I told him that he better listen to me and keep his promise.

When trying to search for anything, something, I searched the GGB podcast for singleness. And came across the concept of knowing yourself and your worth. And then it hit me that I don’t know myself at all, nor my worth. Which is why I’ve been so easily influenced in the past by worldly events, people’s opinions of me. I feel like that’s where the root sin begins.

It’s why I perhaps feel the need for someone to show me who i am, because I don’t even know me. My severe attachment to being with someone.

### The struggle for meaning, and the feeling of emptiness

I’m also struggling with my purpose. I feel empty a lot of the time. I don’t really know what it means for joy/love/peace/satisfaction to come from God. I don’t feel like my relationships are great, I don’t feel like I’ve got relationships that quench the soul or really satisfy me. Mom was right, I kind of only see LG people and that’s it.

### I got nothing

I feel like God struck me down so he can excavate everything and start afresh, because under all that before there was nothing he could use. Within right now, I really don’t feel like there’s much.
