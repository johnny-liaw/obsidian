### reckoning with mom

On Monday I had a really deep and heartfelt conversation with mom. During which I realized that I had been emotionally abusing mom. That the cycle of abuse runs in our family.

Mom said she wants this not to be passed on to the next generation.

Mom says we learnt from dad, unfortunately,

I spent the night and the next day in a lot of anguish as I prayed to god to transform and heal our family. And teach me how to honour mom. I feel like the way I saw mom changed after this day.

### Disagreement with Sachini about house

During our date night on Wednesday, in a passing conversation we realized we were on separate pages. She said she didn’t want unit 2 to be forever home, but I thought that was the plan. And so we had to spend a day or two working through disappointments and upset because I hadn’t been told. Also at the same time, I hadn’t raised a proper forum for her to understand what I’m doing.

Even as I type this on Sunday, I’m learning to let go and put it to bed, god is working on my heart. I feel like I had run ahead and put my desires ahead of gods. I’m praying for wise decision making for god, and the rest he will provide.

### Friday crash

During Friday dinner, my body started to crash, I was super lethargic after.

### Saturday catchup with grace

After Friday’s crash, I just felt horrible in the morning. Had a burger paddy and slowly started to recover. It w terrible though. I honestly wasn’t sure how I was gonna make through grace, Church and dinner after. But somehow I did, praise god,

Several things stood out from grace

- go for pre marriage counselling
- Prioritise and talk about the most important. Everything else forgive and forget.
- Hearing her talk about her struggles with her dad, was eye opening. I was always so frustrated with my own dad.
- In laws, finance, kids.

### Prayers

- teach me how to honor mom and dad
- Help end generational curses and help us walk in generational blessings.
- Wide decision making on finances
