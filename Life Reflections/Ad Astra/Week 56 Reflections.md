### Monday’s Banhmi w/ Sandra

Honestly I woke up today and it just wasn’t it. Maybe yesterday with Sachini was just too intense or something, or the heat or whatever. But I woke up this morning and I just had nothing in me. I was honestly so close to cancelling but I fought through.

The study with Sandra was good. I was made in God’s image. I was made with love, in love, and imbued with God’s attributes.

Then we went into deep discussion about the Sachini situation. My mind is so torn. My heart is full of sorrow. I’m so confused, so deep in a fog that I can’t see through it.

I feel after reflecting on yesterday, I was a bit stiff and my spirit was shut off because I’d shut my feelings off. if i felt nothing I couldn’t get hurt. But that’s not the point, in this situation there needs to be a stake. You can’t be in it and have no stake. Sandra also mentioned that she feels my patience is being worked. She said she also doesn’t envy my position. I played her the audio clips and I couldn’t even look at her, I just felt so much in my chest I couldn’t explain. She also advised it’s not a good idea to have this talk with her, under the pretense that if i felt i wasn’t ready to start anything.

Am I ready? I’m not sure. I said confidently to Sandra that I wasn’t but right now I’m not even sure. I really God to lead me right now and I don’t know what to do.

One thing is clear tho, I’m trying to be too perfect with it. God’s grace is made perfect in weakness, all of the Bible greats and God still fulfilled his promises. Not because mistakes are not okay, but because they persevered in their faith and God is a god whose graceful. I also actively avoid any extra contact, out of fear I’ll overstep and ruin my chances. I’m being a bit too strict with it. Is a friendship outside of the car too much?

I thought about all the different ways I can move things forward, but I want to seek God first. To not control the situation by fleshy means. I want to follow his instructions.

### Before Thursday

I started meditating on God’s grace. And I felt an opening in my chest like I hadn’t felt before. A trusting of God’s love for me more and more. I say to myself, I don’t need to know it, your grace is enough God. I will not rush ahead and do it myself, your grace is sufficient.

And honestly gut issues have not been great. The recent flare up has been annoying, I have no appetite, my gut feels very uncomfortable. Cobwebs were back on wednesday and part of Thursday.

### Thursday

Honestly i wasn’t sure how I was going to get through this day. I wasn’t sure how I was going to do dinner/play/dessert with Sachini, my mind was a bit cooked still. Towards the end I really just was running God’s grace. I prayed so hard about seeking righteousness, not selfish ambition. And I just trusted God that he’d be with me, and guide me during this time, and I surrender the outcome to him.

We started off at citylife church, I get off the car and she’s already getting out of the driver seat for me to drive. When I get in the car we start laughing immediately about it. And then I tried to put my car key in the ignition of her everest and we laugh even more. We’re quite silly with each other.

On the way to Hakana Japanese Kitchen, I told her that I needed to stop by Knox to run an errand real quick. But I cheekily turned into the boom gate and she laughed. I even did it a second time.

On the way to Hakana, i made a wrong turn and I ended up in a side street called 10 Craig Avenue, that house was beautiful, full of character and we really loved it. We turn back to Hakana, and it was a good dinner. It felt like I got to look right at her and was like wow she’s so beautiful.

We go to the 1812 theatre, and we have a great time watching the play at A14 & A15. It was the front row and it was a really good time.

On the way back we go past Kirrawee avenue, we play a game for her to find it and she does, all she wants is Jam donuts and I thought that was so cute.

We drop by Knox to use the bathroom at pancake parlour. And later we ended up at the lake in the middle of the night, sitting on the bench arms in contact with each other. I can’t even remember at this point honestly but we spoke about a lot of things. We get cold and then we head back to the car. We spoke about the future lifegroup, how we want to minister to them, etc.

Back in the car, we turn on the heater and we keep talking, it was like 1130pm at this point or something. I don’t even remember how we started talking about the conversation. But we spoke about what it meant to us. She said that she felt guys like me didn’t exist and she felt God put someone like that right in front of her. I told her that weekend meant a lot to me too, that the outline was filled in and colored out. She said she didn’t realize what `so guys like you do exist` would’ve meant for me. And I told her that yes it means a lot, as someone who struggled with feeling seen and here there’s this beautiful woman who says i see you, that means so much.

The conversation eventually drifts to me saying, I think we’re 1+1=3, she agrees. And I thought that we’re partners in Christ, and are going in the same direction, she agrees as well. We enjoy spending time together and time just flies. And afterwards I just laid out all my cards, and said with or without something more with you, I’d want to lead with you. And I forgot what happened but we had a little moment and I asked if we should pray together, at the same time offering her my hand. She takes it and I immediately grab both of it and start praying. At one point I think she starts to rub her cries and starts crying. Some random guy outside wants to charge his phone in the car. And honestly I forgot what I said in the prayer but I felt it was kind of a momentous occasion for our relationship because we’re opening who we are in God first and foremost.

Oh yeah I also learn that she had to surrender me too, and was struggling with it or something? But i definitely told her my struggles w.r.t. her.

She said I was really patient with God. I told her it’s cus I don’t see an alternative, all other paths were exhausted.

Aterwards I leaned in for a hug and we just held on to each other for quite a long time, for how long I forgot but it was blissful. She kept breathing hard into my shoulder. I held her hand, she held mind. At one point it was on my chest. She holds on to my shoulder. I start giving her little pecks on the forehead. She said I’m an answered prayer. And we just kept thanking God. She said she’s so happy right now, and you could see the little girl full of joy. She then prays over us. You were worth the wait she says.

Her mom keeps calling so I drive us home, but before I do i say “hand please” and she grabs hold of it with both hands, and brings it up to her lips/chin. Gave her a kiss on the cheek before I said bye and we both drove home.

I notice that during the night, we never once said the words “i like you”, “i have feelings for you”, it was a very different conversation the way we came together.

### grace catchup in Saturday

Wow what a catchup I needed.

Grace said that there are 3 people in every relationship. God at the top, two people move closer when they move closer towards God, what an analogy. I need to focus on moving closer to God.

She said that my walk with God has matured because I’ve been getting better at not letting Sachini overtake my mind.

I told her that I have doubts on whether what we did on Thursday was the right timing. And she said these doubts are good because they are putting God first.

I told her about what mom said regarding challenges, but grace said what period doesn’t have challenges? After 18 years of marriage with her husband, things don’t get easier, because life gets tougher.

Grace said her and mom are two sides of the same coin. Mom has seen my bad days and is naturally more cautious, Grace sees hope.

Grace says that mom just needs to hear Sachini pray and she’ll be more at ease, I agree.

Grace said we might have very different communication styles. Because in her mind the parents thing could mean things are official? But in my mind I’m not sure, because those words are not said just yet.

Grace said if I’m running towards Sandra or her before God, it means I’m not putting God first in this relationship.

I admitted that I felt so powerless trying to protect our relationship from all these things. Grace said I don’t have to, just focus on God. He will help you. It reminds me something Sandra said to me last night, if God brought you together, he will get you through.

When you have issues or feel like the enemy is attacking, rebuke them first, ask the Holy Spirit to come in. And pray for nations.

### first date with Sachini

Today was the first date, honestly it was great we had a lot of fun.

Started off at church, when she came down I was happy to see her. Gave her a hug and she went to change. After she got back I grabbed her hand very naturally and we walked to the car.

In the car, started off with prayer, and it’s intentional consecrating our time together.

- I would be honored to be your girlfriend.
- She’s happy just to spend time with me
- We spoke about honoring each other. It’s about lifting the other person up, and not devaluing them.
- Her love language is physical touch and quality time, presence, she says.
- We decided to not kiss till the wedding.
- I need you to protect me, because I don’t trust myself.
