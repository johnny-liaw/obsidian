This week was both simultaneously better than the last and tougher.

Work wise it overall went well, was able to focus and do my work and towards the 2nd half of the week I was able to relax into my work a lot more and take the pressure off. I started this timeboxed note taking system which I think will continue, just to self check that iâ€™m working on the most important thing at that time and not multitasking.

However mood/mental health wise was a bit more rocky. Starting from Tuesday, could be diet related but I started to feel more off. I felt so off on Tuesday after work that I decided not to go to BJJ and stay home to rest.

> ðŸ’¤Â I had a dream that I got fired, and was really sad. I think this is Godâ€™s way of telling me that my identity is tied to my work.

I felt like the moodswings were just plenty, was just questioning God when it would stop.

Doubts like am I to marry? Meet someone? Live a normal life? How do I do that when the ups and downs keep on coming.

On Thursday, I started to feel like life is so unsatisfying. Like I donâ€™t really know what it is and what Iâ€™m doing. The end doesnâ€™t seem to be insight and my life just isnâ€™t what I thought it would be. At the same time I feel God put it on my heart to talk to Caleb about Practicing The Way. I did and he loved the idea, and said I should lead a session. I gave it a nightâ€™s rest to think about it and eventually said yes. Felt like this was Godâ€™s way of answering my purposeless suffering.

> ðŸ’¤Â Friday night, I had a dream where I was being prayed over by Ken Fish. Something about casting out something. And before he could finish I got ripped out of the dream and put in a dark mental prison. I was fearful, it was scary, and it was definitely a spiritual intimidation. I had to force myself away and rebuke it with every might in me.

> ðŸ’¤Â Following the spiritual intimidation, I remember a figure like Jesus pushing my head down into a resting position. And it was the most peaceful/loving feeling ever.

Friday and Saturdayâ€™s mental health was worse. It felt like the other voice was very active. Partly because I read into the pastor story. Note to self these things are still very triguing and I shouldnâ€™t go near it at all. It was very persistent and twisting every situation that happens in my life in the worst possible light. Mom had to sleep with me Saturday night. In our bedtime conversation, I confided in mom that Iâ€™m a dreamer, and she told me to write down my dreams. But it was scary cus the other voice hadnâ€™t been this active since that period in May.

> ðŸ’¤Â early sunday I had a dream, where dad + sis + myself were climbing stairs. It looks kind of like a fireescape and there was like one door per floor. And the floors were weird. There was floors, and then there were subfloor levels. And I remember we were trying to get to close level 7, subfloor 6. Thatâ€™s really all I remember from it. Iâ€™m not sure what it really means.

  

In the spirit of recording down my other dreams, the below are some additional ones that have happened in the past:

> ðŸ’¤Â I remember I had a dream about Justine. I canâ€™t remember what we were doing, it mightâ€™ve been an adventure where a van was involved. But I remember it feeling very sweet. God is this from you? What are you trying to tell me?

> ðŸ’¤Â There was another dream I had, where I was speaking to some white guy Iâ€™ve never met before. He was talking about how he made into MMA (or something like that) and we were walking up these spiral stairs. His accomplishments were impressive, and Iâ€™m not sure if bragging is the word because he was just talking about it. But I didnâ€™t feel like it was a great conversation. Whatâ€™s meant to impress actually intimidates. This is defintiely another message from God and I will take it to heart.

  

One of the other core things from this week was that I wasnâ€™t sure how to have that catchup with Megz. I feel like Iâ€™m conflicted, the Johnny before that I know I can no longer be. And as I was taking a poop after dinner, it came to me that I should be honest about it. About who I really am and who I need to be. This all comes down to tender connections that Iâ€™m learning. Especially after that podcast with John Mark Comer, I realized that I had too many friends in Sydney. What I really need is less friends, and deeper relationships. The soul friends that know the good and the bad. The ones you truly do life with. And I realized that the way I approach social interactions is sort of impressing/selling/prostituting myself approach. Itâ€™s about an emotional spiked high, not about a genuine tender connection. This is something I will continue to pray about.

  

### Prayer list

1. what is the purpose of my suffering?
2. Who did you create me to be?
3. Help me surrender parts of myself that arenâ€™t from you.
4. How do i continue to encounter you?
5. Give me wisdom. To do the right thing at the right time for the right reasons.
6. For friends whom I can call soul friends, where we can deepen our relationship with Christ together.
7. Healing and renewal.
8. To seek Godâ€™s approval and not human approval. To not sell myself, but to please God instead.
9. A life partner. One whom we can build our union around God and raise a God fearing family.

  

### Things to think about for the coming week:

1. As Grace said, focus on what God wants me to do vs what the enemy is saying to me.
