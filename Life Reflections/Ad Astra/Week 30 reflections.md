|[[Ad Astra/DreamDB/Untitled\|Untitled]]|Had a dream earlier in the week where I was forcing a guy in the bathroom to take drugs. And then when I tried doing it for a while, he kept screaming and people were noticing and so I started to run away. I was wondering around the city and I finally came to a gate of sorts, when I tried to enter a guy stop me and when I try to leave you would pull me back and I couldn't get away. After this I woke up .  <br>  <br>I woke up feeling like my heart was very corrupted, and I feel very impure. I guess that makes sense because I was having a really tough weekend prior, I was questioning a lot of things such as my mental health and my singleness and just overall complaining a lot to God. And I think this is a lesson that my heart gets corrupted when I complain.|September 15, 2024|DD-32|

### Complaining corrupts the heart

I realize that I was only interested in God's blessing rather than God himself. This was a pretty big revelation, and there's something that I feel I want to continue to explore so I can better focus on my faith probably.

### Finding your identity in God

After Saturday dinner with the Life group, I realized that I wasn't as bothered because nothing much happened between Justine and I. It's sort of the beginning of a revelation, or Discovery of a new piece of land, where I can build my identity separate to women and relationships. Earlier in the week I came to the conclusion that even if I got together with Justine, it will be without God's blessing, if that's the case would it be truly a satisfying relationship? Probably not.  
  

I'm also beginning to realize that I was created in God's image. God's nature is to love, so therefore it is mine too. I have been given these gifts freely. I also reflected, what would it take for me to believe in the good things about myself? And I couldn't come up with anything. So this means that it's not that I don't believe, it's that I don't want to believe. I pray to God that this wall that's erected within my heart can be knocked down and removed. So I can believe in the identity that he created me for, and the gifts that he has given me.

  

I'm also beginning to realize the extent in which I put my identity in being funny, and being bombastic, and people's opinions and validations and what they think of me and how they react to me in social situations. This is hampering my relationship with God, my identity in God. And it's something I want to continue to work at moving forward.

  

I I also want to work on rehabilitating my image of singleness, whereby I don't view myself as incomplete/leftover/not enough because I am not in a relationship.
