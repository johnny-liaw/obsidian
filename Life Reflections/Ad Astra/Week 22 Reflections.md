I had a catchup with Megz on monday. And going into it I was super nervous, I wasn’t sure what was going to happen. But I just surrendered it to God. It ended up being an okay chat, it was great to get on the same page about things but it was also a little draining. Afterwards I felt a sense of freedom. Like I no longer needed to sell myself.

on Tuesday, I had just the biggest crash. Was in bed from 7p → 8a. Was not a good day for sure. I tried my best to keep my faith. Wednesday and Thursday were both very tough days at work. High number of mood swings, anxiety. All that jazz. But I adopted a range of strategies like frequent walks, working at the deck to get me through it. I feel like this experience really sharpened my faith in God. He’ll get me through it. Worry less.

Like Jeffrey Rachmat said during Inspire conference day 1, focus on scattering seeds, and remember that God is always working, even when you’re asleep. And that goes into his later message on personal faith. Where when you face a problem that you alone have to face.

I also had a number of dreams this week, oddly they all had various women in my life.

> One was with Teresa, we were at some kind of swimming thing. She pointed out her dad and I was like wow your dad is very tall.

> Another dream, megz and I were making out in some bathroom stall.

> Another dream, I was flirting with one of the girls from the TBNx talks. And then another girl with glasses I had never seen before. Later Liv grabbed me, put my arms around her waist in a flrtatious way.

I don’t really know what any of these dreams mean. Father, can you give me the ability to interpret dreams?

I also realized this week that I had not been exercising enough. So I biked thursday, saturday and sunday. Sunday’s weather was good so it was outdoors. And towards the end of the bike ride outdoors, I felt a sense of joy and peace that I had not felt since 5-6 months ago. It was just refreshing to be able to feel little moments of joy like that again, I’d almost forgotten what it felt like.

As I was typing this, I was going through a bit of a mood swing moment. And man do I dislike those swings. It really knocks you off your axis. From the mood of peace you descend into the mood of hades, just negative, despair.

My prayer to God for the coming week is to surrender more to him.

Friday after work, I turned off my phone and turned off my laptop. I quite enjoyed that honestly, it was a total disconnection. I might do this more often. After work hours, I’ll be totally disconnected.

During my bible reads this week, the story of Joseph stood out to me. “It was not you who sent me here, but God”. I feel like I could use this reminder often that it was God who put me in this position, for his reasons. I do not know those reasons. But I have to surrender each and every moment and build my faith everyday to withstand the storms of burnout.
