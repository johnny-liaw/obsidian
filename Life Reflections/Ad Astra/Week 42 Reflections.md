### wanting to date

On Monday night I prayed to god a prayer from the heart. In a way I don’t think I’ve ever prayed to him before. Lord, I want to date, but I want to do it your way.

### Doctopus presentation

Started my preparation for this talk a little later than usual, I wanted to trust gods spirit guiding me, and practice stressing less.

The night before we had the last word and worship, I thought that tomorrow’s presentation will be a living sacrifice for god, as a testament to his goodness and his work in my life. That he would bestow someone like me, with a messed up mind and couldn’t even wash dishes, the opportunity to work on one of the most important projects in the company.

The presentation seemed to be well received, praise god, glory goes to him.

### Realization about love

I realize this during word and worship, that unless I know someone deeply I will never love them. I might find girls attractive but that’s just surface level, I cannot love them If I don’t know them.

  

### Taking Friday off

Honestly praise god, though I had to take a day off today cus I was so tired. Yesterday Was the most hectic day I’ve had in 10 months and god has still enable me to function. I had a fe forum,I spoke for 25 minutes which was the longest I had ever spoken for. And then immediately after work I had volunteering at clcc and didn’t finish until almost 9pm. God has brought me this far.
