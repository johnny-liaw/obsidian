> Had a dream last night, something something the girl (i marry?) is someone who’s into photography? That was confusing. I have no idea how to interpet these or if i’m even interpreting them right. There was also an earlier part but I forgot it.

> Had a dream that I was in Japan during February, when it was snowing

> Had another dream that Ellie was going through something, that’s why she hasn’t been responding to my messages.

### Ellie

She called me weds night out of the blue, after more than 3 weeks of radio silence. She’s going through a lot, I tried to act with grace. I said she should come to LG, she said yes initially and then later said she’ll stay in. I sent her a wishing well message but I don’t feel good about it. I feel burdened somehow. Looking back at it I wished I’d been more gracious, she’s going through a hard time.

### LG / a mid night reckoning

During wednesday’s lifegroup, Justine was there. There was some light joking around initially and she started joking that I was a fake malaysian and grew up in China. Honestly not sure why but it really hit a nerve, and I was more reclused and closed in for the rest of the night. Maybe I felt really invalidated?

In the middle of the night, I woke up feeling really angry about the situation. I prayed and reflected on it, and realized that I fill my brokenness within with validation, sex, sexual validation. And this whole time I’ve been filling it with all these things. It felt like I was seeing these things so much clearly now.

Earlier in the week I came to the realization that a lot of my subconcious thinking ends up “i wanna be good enough for a person like that”, esp when I see someone who’s attractive. it puts me in this always striving never good enough mindset, which does not feel conducive. It seems like such a central metric I judge myself on, whether I can attract someone of x caliber in to my life. This feels wrong.

Also, because I use girls for validation, I’m interested earlier on, and afterwards I tend to lose interest.

I used to pay for dating apps, I was just so desperate for someone. And after I discovered SD, I went at it like it was going to solve all my problems. I even looking up prostitution prices or something at one point, I wasn’t going to do it, but just the thrill of being close to that.

I have the mindset that if i end up with someone who’s not physically attractive, I almost feel unsatisfied. Like there’s a ‘what if’. Which was exactly what happened with Euiyoung, Ashley and Melissa. **No one is good enough for you, because you’re never good enough for yourself.**

I idolize women, to fill this brokenness within me, instead of God.

If I dated viv, I would feel unsatisfied (i wrote this earlier in the week). I want to feel guilty but I just don’t feel that way.

### Tackling face and neck tensions

Finally seeing a myotherapist to tackle some face tensions. And realized how tight my back/neck is. Also realized my jaw is always tense.

### Putting genuine connection first

On Saturday, there were only 4 of us, so we had a more intimate dinner at our favorite Greek place. I joked around a lot less, and focused on asking questions, listening and understanding the people in front of me, particularly Sachini. I came away from that night feeling more rejuvenated and soul filled than I have in a very long time. I even karaoke’d in the car on the way back to Ed Sheeran hahah, which was something I haven’t done in a very long time.

### 6 months

Today marks 6 months since the move back, a lot has happened, and i’ve got some ways to go. Praise God that I’ve gotten this far.
