### Wednesday spiritual battles

I had a massive spiritual battle, lots of things were being said and I just felt super insecure about the relationship.

Some of the lies included

- you're bringing in problems that will affect the relationship
- if I over step and idolize the relationship I will lose it
- if you can't bring the best of yourself you're gonna lose her
- what if God asks you to give her up?  
    When I prayed to God if I should talk to you about it, the fog lifted  
    
- I feel like I need to be perfect, or I'm gonna lose you. And it's this fear that I'm trapped in.

and it felt like I was getting pulled deeper and deeper, it was miserable

  

At the workshop later, I prayed to god if I should talk to her about it, and the fog lifted from me. Sandra also encouraged me to do so. When I did she listened and empathised really well.

- I love you for who you are.
- I choose to love all of you.
- You won’t lose me.

And it felt like she really ministered to my soul. That wounded part of me. But I’m so bogged down in hurt that I’m not even sure how to interpret what just happened. I felt safe and just wanted to be in her arms.

We then prayed over each other. She said I didn’t have to carry the burden anymore.

- she is the crown, I am the leader.
- I am the leader of our family. Our children.
- I don’t have to become, I already am.
- Thank you for letting me serve you.

I feel like I’ve arrived at a space I’ve never been at before. Everything is so foreign.

There’s this opening in my heart, I just want to serve her. To love her.

### Gut issues

I have been struggling with gut issues massively this week. I spent quite a few days vomiting and even went to the ER on Thursday. Sachini did come to visit me and she ended up meeting my parents then. It was just tough, I couldn’t eat much. I can’t go out much either because I’m afraid my gut will act up.

### Sunday with sachini

it was a good day getting the day to spend with her. We were just on a mat near the park, it was everything to me. We said I love you to each other. But now I’m doubting myself, did I say it too soon? Am I leading the relationship in the right way? God give me wisdom.
