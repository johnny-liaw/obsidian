### feeling drained

After time with her, I feel like I’m just feeling drained, and I could t explain it. Am I seeing her so many times? Do I need to orient my relationship with God? And eventually felt like the relationship was very kaboursome. It was a lot of doing and not being. Which reflected my relationship with god.

I started asking myself questions such as what does it mean to be rooted in God? I really wanted to know more about being his son, my mind just goes blank at that.

⭐ I surrender my desire for how I want to contribute to this relationship. I surrender the spirit of works and striving with your grace.

⭐ it is not me who builds this relationship but you.

⭐ Sachini really encouraged me to lean into my relationship and identity in God above all else.

### Processing childhood trauma

I felt like it was this week where I acknowledged the full childhood trauma. The abuse mom directed at me. The lack of leadership dad exhibited in the house. I felt heaviness in my chest, and it was super painful to acknowledge and go through everything.

I was an emotional punching bag, I was an emotional vomit bag for their marriage. I prayed to God to help me process this.

I was never sat down, encouraged and built up.

My boundaries were repeatedly broken.

⭐ Sachini said it’s amazing how I encourage her, despite never been encouraged myself growing up.

### opening up to her

On Friday night, I finally told her about all the evil I did up in Sydney. She listened beautifully and held the space to encourage me. She said I love you for who you are now. I felt safe.

### Sunday night

After spending the day at church with her, mom came into my room and said other friends are important too. That going through life as a man, I need other guy friends too. Otherwise it gets really hard, as the relationship can’t be my source of satisfaction.

That short conversation really convicted me and got me thinking, these past few weeks, other than Sachini, I haven’t really done much of other things. maybe this is why I was inadvertently feeling drained? That I need a variety of hobbies and outlets to recharge my cup. I will seek god for this.
