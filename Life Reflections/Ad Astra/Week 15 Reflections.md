It felt like this week was an absolutely hellfire of a week.

Monday actually felt quite normal, I felt so good that I even did a 50min sesh with Danyon going through the codebase. And then after did another hour with Urooj catching up on life and I was full on preaching to her about God and how meaningless everything is unless God is at the center of it. Surprisingly, she actually took to what I said and she “i raised a mirror” to her. It’s crazy how I got through to her as a person who’s burnt out and still recovering. And then afterwards did an hour with Scott therapy session. Shortly after I started to crash, and was just feeling absolutely terrible after. To the point where I had to take Tuesday off.

On Tuesday the family thought it’d be a good idea to drive across town to look for bike helmets, and I ended up feeling worse and spiralling to an even worse mood. Wednesday I felt maybe slightly better, and Thursday too. However on Thursday I went for a bike ride and after i came back I had another significant crash. Maybe the bike ride was more intense than usual cus of the headwinds. Where it was even hard to focus on Friday during work. At this point I was just so done, the thing I thought would be good for me ended up making it worse. I’m kind of at a loss for words, I wanted so much to be getting better. I would wake up in the middle of the night and have these spiritual debates and arguments with God like why is this happening to me, why have you foresaken me? I didn’t undrestand it. I was so frustrated, I even swore several times at him. And to be honest, there were times I didn’t want to live. What is the point of living like this? Where life is already so minimal, and any attempts to live better means it gets worse. Why are you doing this to me? What do you get out of it?

During the week, Viv told me an analogy about staying still on the treadmill, you’re moving, but you’re also staying still. Admittedly, my default mode is to try and get ahead of the treadmill and live more. However we know that’s not possible right now. I guess my circumstances/God wants me to live differently. To be content laying low. To surrender my sense of self and to be living a certain way in order to feel good. But what am I doing though, life is already so minimal, God. God? Why? Maybe this is one of those things where I don’t understand it, and I just have to be obedient and go through it. And trust that this is all part of his plan. The scary part is that there’s just no visibility through this fog. It’d be a lot easier if i just know how to navigate the brain fog, the emotional fatigue, the mood swings. A lot of my anxiety stems from not sure if what im about to do next is going to have me feeling worse/more fatigued.

Maybe my definition of a good life is too tied to output and living a certain way, and that needs to change. To be okay with a very minimal engagement with the outside world compared to where I was before. One where I’m just focused on resting and God. Feeling good is not an invitation to do more.

On Saturday I had my baptism, and honestly it felt a bit like God’s plan. Turns out it was aunty viv who was the one baptizing me, and then it was Kendrick who was on stage worshipping. Everyone was there and it was just a great time. I was honestly super nervous through out it all, but everyone was there for me so that felt a lot better. Before going I really felt like I wanted to isolate, but with everyone there supporting me I just felt a lot better and energized. During which I got several words

- Patrick: God wants you to know that he’s never foresaken you.
- Patrick: God wants you to let go of something with relationships/people? I forgot what he said here exactly, maybe he meant events? Something to do with people.
- Grace: The darkness you’re going through is armoring you up.
- Aunty viv said something else, but I forgot what it was.
- But after the baptism patrick said something entered me, but I’m not sure. It definitely was something though. Quite the experience.

  

I remember during the week, there were a lot of prayers on my part. Particularly about JK, i told god to grow my heart for servantship before my feelings/my healing. I also told God that if it doesn’t add to his kingdom, don’t let it happen, my life is no longer mine.

  

### Learnings

1. A good day is when you’re not swept away, and you’re still on the treadmill.
2. Feeling good is not an invitation to do more.
3. When you’re feeling bad, do not exercise intensely.
