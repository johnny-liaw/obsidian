### Struggles with guilt

I was feeling a lot of guilt this week. Didn't feel like sharing with Mom, lied to her about beach. Idk why I just don't feel like talking to Mom at the moment, and she keeps wanting to ask questions. I don't understand why that is, do I feel ashamed or something? To hide?

After asking Sandra if she wants to go to the beach, I felt tremendous guilt as well after, and my mood was just foul for 2 hours.

### Grace

Talking to grace, I opened up about a lot of things. Including Sandra stuff which IDK why I felt so guilty about. Now looking back I was like what is the big deal?

If I didn't do anything wrong, the guilt and the lack of peace is from the enemy.

Its not that feelings are bad, they aren't. They are normal and I don't need to feel stupid that I let it get this far with Justine. Her entanglements are to be sorted out and I won't get a full experience with her anyway.

Its interesting because at Caleb's house, I looked at her a few times and I felt indifferent about her. Praise God. Continue to detach me and take it all away. Because of Christ there is no condemnation. Its interesting though I did feel guilty for not being as open as I normally am. Maybe that's just the self critical part.

Something interesting that grace mentioned was that maybe running towards the attraction is what the issue is.

Also learning to fill the void with what God wants you to do, in a way that doesn't make you tired.
