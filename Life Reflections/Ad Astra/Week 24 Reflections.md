This week was a bit of a tough one, was sick of it, so I ended up coughing most of it, staying home and not doing much. Unfortunately couldn’t exercise much, and couldn’t go to church over the weekend. Felt a bit like life is a lot of nothing atm until I can get back to normal activity.

I’m really cooked as I write this down, today was a lot of moving and packing.

But I feel this week in my journals, I’m confronting that overarching and blanket feeling of not being enough. Not being enough for intimacy and intimate connections. That’s my biggest fear and what I search for. But intimacy itself when obtained doesn’t satisfy that emptiness. A question I’ve been asking myself a lot this week has been “and then what?”. I can obtain everything I’ve ever wanted to obtain, but it would simply not be enough. I would rather have a quarter from God than 100% from my desires.

I’m still trying to figure out what fills the cup. it just feels like something is missing. Holy spirit I pray that you lead my life, and continue to reveal yourself to me.

> I had a dream this week, I forgot what it was but i distinctly remember a prostitude or something was holding on to my arm and showing great interest, and I just kept walking with her linking arms.

Feels a bit like a wakeup call, that I allow my integrity and worth to be polluted by whatever gives me validation.
