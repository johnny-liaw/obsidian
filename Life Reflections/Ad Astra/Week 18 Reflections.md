This week was so much more than what I’d normally deal with.

First, mom + dad had a massive yelling fight on Monday evening. I remember crying/tearing up several times going to sleep because of how sad I felt. This created a lot of stress for me, it made me feel very uneasy.

On top of that, there was a bug in the `ResourceCollector` PR that I merged and had to revert it. On top of that the whole debugging process took about a day and I was just spent after that because it was quite stressful.

On Thursday, I had to deal with a `/fill` incident and spent it trying to revert/debug and all that stuff. At the time it honestly felt like I was dealing with so much. I was petrified of going overboard and than regressing mentally afterwards, but at the same time, I haven’t felt these feelings of stress in a very long time and in general it just made me feel very uncomfortable. I fell asleep on Thursday feeling like my nervous system is just shot and I wasn’t sure if I was going to call in sick on Friday because I just felt awful. But I distinctly remember not losing hope and keeping my focus on God.

I barely slept when I woke up on Friday, and I honestly had no idea whether I was still going to work that day. I was clearly not sleeping well, my nervous system was shot. But after breakfast I told myself that I’d just do a little bit and see what happens. I kept going and by the end of the day I solved the issue and cherrypicked the bug to prod, praise God. The morning daily bible prayer was “help me see the situation the way you see the situation” - that really helped me.

I felt like i was tested this past week. I don’t feel like I’ve gotten enough rest over the weekend and I still feel like I don’t really want to start work on Monday, but I’m glad I kept my eyes on God, no matter what happened. Because he delivered me through it all.

I also had several dreams throughout the week:

1. One where Caleb kept remind ing me of all the lies I told. And when I asked why he said it’s to destroy the pride within me. Pride is the death of us all.
2. One where I was in NY and I had to choose between spending time with friends or spending time with family. Felt like that dream was telling me to never put friends over family.
3. There was a 3rd one too, but I forgot what it was.

  

Over the weekend, I was kind of flat for the most of it. But it was fine because besides church I just spent it with family and stayed home. I feel like I’m truly learning how to rest. And it’s all about doing less. And being okay with being less.

One of the few key things I want to work on coming up is:

- ability to deal well with stressful situations
- dealing with the many thing “i haven’t done”

  

I want to continue to let go of more control I have in life, in unknown situations, and deliver it all to God. To trust him throughout it all, and to see the situations the way he sees it.
