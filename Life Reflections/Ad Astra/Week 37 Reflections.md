### Orbis #2 [[Orbis #2]]

It was this week where I realized how damaging my submission to Adam was.

### Catchup with Megz / Post

Honestly the catchup with Megz felt a bit strange, like I felt distance from her. We were talking but it didn’t feel like we’re on the same page.

I felt like there wasn’t much we could talk about besides gossiping. And I didn’t really want to gossip anymore, faith has become increasingly important to me, and it felt like she’s just not in the same spot as me and where I want to go.

After the catchup, I felt more fatigued than I’ve felt in a very long time. Even right now the day after as I write this, I feel a sense of emotional low and a lack of energy/fatigue. Lord take this away from me, make me healed.

I’m stressed thinking about a bunch of things, like the dinner, like catching up with Lucy next week.

Is it because I had chips/fried chicken last night? That probably wouldn’t be very good for my gut.

### Saturday dinner (viv’s surprise)

Almost did not go to this one, in the lead up I really needed mom’s encouragement to go. On the drive there I listened to worship music to feel better, but I really didn’t know how I was going to make it through dinner because that’s how low I was feeling. I ended up making it through dinner fine and also went to play pool with Kendrick after. Interesting that I felt better after this social session and not the one with Megz.

### Sunday

Sunday I felt slightly better, but honestly still not normal. Idk what’s going on with my mind but the lull wasn’t iron related. Probably just a seasonal low. Thinking of things like catching up with Lucy, LG session and the FE forum make me stressed. I think I just need to reduce what’s on my plate at the moment. All these things are not what I’m used to.
