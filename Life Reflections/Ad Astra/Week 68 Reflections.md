### Health updates

Monday and Tuesday were health days, got new meds from Ken Tan and then got an update on the blood work from Dr. Hew. Turns out there’s nothing wrong with my blood, which was actually a bit upsetting because I was hoping we’d be able to catch something which would explain the fatigue spells. Not vitamin D, not B12, not glucose or anything like that. I wanted to have some kind of a way forward to fixing any blood issues, but that doesn’t seem to be the case. The only thing I was told was that I needed to make sure I eat more and have ample protein after workouts.

### God answering work project

I was praying to God to tell me what I should work on next at work, whether I should move on to the new team and whether changing coaches would be a good idea. But he answered this week and I’ll be working on the Capabilities project but with Julia still as my coach. Seems to be the best of both worlds.

### Avy’s text

Avy texted me out of the blue, saying she needs sachini’s last name because she’s currently doing invites. When I saw that, my heart just sank. I’ve been dragging my feet telling Avy this. And when i had to finally deliver the news over text, I had so much unease and lack of peace. But I take comfort in knowing God has it and he’s faithful. Right now as I write this there’s so much unease, and uncertainty not knowing how she’s gonna react. But Sachini has also been praying into it and I pray that God’s will be done, and not mine. I i empty myself and be a vessel for him.

### Sachini’s struggles

She admitted to me on Sunday that she feels like she’s losing a battle with passions of the flesh. That she’s not doing a good enough job and she’s worried she won’t be able to honor me. She even said that she thinks I deserve better (enemy is talking). I then spent the next little bit encouraging her and letting her know that we are imperfect, and it is God who will strengthen and protect us. She said she listened to my voice note multiple times and found great comfort in it.

### The Spirit of Insignificance

On Friday/Saturday, we started talking about sex. And I admit that sometimes I fear not being able to be satisfied. Or even afraid to admit how important it is to me. I admitted to her that through sex I’ve felt really insignificant and broken from past experiences, and that sometimes I’d rather reject myself than allow myself to be in a situation where others reject me. In that moment of vulnerability she holds me and says she’s proud of who I am. I really needed that.

### Entering a season of meeting friends

Starting with our families on Monday, then Avy + Jake on Saturday. We’re entering a season of meeting friends. I’ve got her Ford friends, Mai, Kavita, Sindhu, Paulynn + Caleb all lined up. It came about organically and maybe that’s just the season that God has planned for us. And I pray that God watches over us as we enter it.

### Prayer List

- Good health and sound mind as we head into the season of meeting friends.
- Deliverance from the spirit of insignificance and to pray for sexual purity for both me and Sachini.
