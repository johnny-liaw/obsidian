### New Year’s Eve testing

For some reason when I was with Jarvis getting a haircut, I was super self conscious, watching everything I say and all that. Just honestly being quite timid.

Later on, at vivs, the first thing Justine says when I walkthrough the door was I looked like a bus driver. That really knocked me off my axis and I felt super disconnected after. I remember I was talking to Caleb and I didn’t even want to look at her, it was quite uncalled for and humiliating.

Afterwards I learned some details about Ellie and it pushed me further into a shroud. And when no one knew my birthday I felt like just so disconnected from everybody. Felt like life was happening and I was on the other side of the looking glass. I felt something super heavy on me, I couldn’t explain it. I was super quiet as well and Justine came over and asked if I was okay. I felt like everyone else were friends and I was just there.

On the drive home I felt super unsatisfied, empty, like something was missing.

### following days

The following days I was honestly pretty sad and gloomy. Ike idk something just descended upon me. But by a chance encounter I found Mike Cornell’s sermon on rejection, and it hit e pretty hard.

I’ve been dealing with the spirit of rejection my entire life, trying to be acceptable in all that I do. I’ve carried so much shame, embarrassment, pain and hurt. And before this I honestly believed that I was just rejected Iife, living like a wounded child where nothing good will ever come to me.

Mike Cornell said a wounded heart stops you from feeling gods love and accepting what he hhas given you. So I’ve been praying for him. To restore my heart before my circumstance.

I remember on Friday night, I was in so much pain processing past events that I had tears In my eyes as I laid in bed to let them out. I took so much rejection personally.

But after praying for a few days into it and processing all the shame and hurt in the past, I feel better, I can think better. I am more defiant against the spirit of rejection, I’m recognizing it more now. I feel like I understand gods nature better too, no longer a dictator. But someone who loves and wants to bless. Jesus work on the cross has already paid for me.

I feel like I’ve been living like the condemned, because of the past 11 months I felt like I was just being punished, rejected by god for my past. But maybe that isn’t the case. Maybe he was with me the whole time, and he wants to bring better things to my life.

That he gave me desires, dreams, and that these aren’t wrong things.

On Sunday I went with mom to the city church, and I had a conversation with Jen, felt like a normal conversation but it was a big step for me as someone who struggled for so long socially cus of mental health issues. and afterwards I was able to look around at women and not feel guilty? Like I don’t feel the need to approach and prove myself anymore. The spirit of proving was something I had been praying about too.

One of the bigger realizations is that there an element of seeking validation from women that I am someone who is lovable. I want to pray more into this.
