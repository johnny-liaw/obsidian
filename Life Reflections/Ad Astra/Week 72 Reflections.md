### Wednesday (Hadestown)

We got lunch at Snow Monkey Ramen, then watched the show. All up spent about 7 hours together. It was the first time where I actively tried to not strive. In the car ride there and back, I didn’t even speak much. And it was fine. Afterwards I had a big crash, which made me really cynical towards life and everything. This is the kind of crash that I’m most afraid of, and I have PTSD over.

### Friday

Went to the Ken Fish thing, and it was honestly really good. He spoke on Jonah and how he as a prophet almost missed his revival. He valued his own lifestyle over God’s calling. I found that relatable. He also had a hard heart, was grumbling and was complaining. I feel that too.

Ken really convicted me that I was choosing to love my life, what I want to do over God. Even my own relationship has taken a higher place than God.

Afterwards, as I stood around waiting for prayer at the alter call. The first lady that came up to me was Michelle. She said she wanted to honor me for waiting, and not leaving. I thought that was really nice. Then she said something like God wants to put something in your hand, what is it? And the first thing that came to mind was a sword. And what’s the sword for? For pulling down strongholds. I honestly thought the exercise was a bit wishy washy and a bit gimmicky, however there’s a verse specifically on using the sword of God to pull down strongholds, which was not at all in my mind when that happened. She said this was a season of learning how to use the sword. Mom said the sword is God’s word.

Afterwards, two ladies prayed for me. Lani and Amy. One of them very quickly caught on that she feels I’m a helper, that I feel the need to fix other people’s problems. Which is very true. The other said I was a perfectionist. Which is also true. One of them then said, when you’re about to do something, pause. Ask yourself, God is this my portion? I thought that was really helpful. Afterwards I had a really vivid dream at night. One of the ladies also said life got busy and God hasn’t taken center stage, which also true.

I also worry, do I have things that I have not been delivered of? I did so much Ayahuasca/LSD/mushrooms things.

### Saturday

I felt convicted that mindfulness isn’t what I should be doing. It’s not spiritually clean. The founder of the app is also an ex buddhist so that can’t be good. So I started using the Pause app. I’m praying for the Holy Spirit to guide me to have a better meditation routine to anchor my mind.

I also started listening to a bunch of Ken Fish podcasts, and felt convicted that I hadn’t been fanning into the flame of God. That I hadn’t been devoting enough time to him. Daniel and David had a personal devotional routine.
