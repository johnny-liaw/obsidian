### Monday deliverance

On Monday I had a surprise prayer session with Amy and Dinny.

They started by honoring me, and it’s incredible because I’ve never had that done for me before. I felt like I was constantly put down.

They asked about forgiveness, and there were a lot of people I needed to forgive. Mom, dad, Adam, Jess. So much pain so much resentment in my heart.

- there are many partitions in my heart, cus of all the past hurt,
- I rely on me to hold it together, it’s me or nothing.
- Dinny: she had an image of me relaxing on a beach.
- All my stress is in my stomach
- God loves me. I will pray over young people, I’m a leader.
- God is going to accelerate you
- Amy: you’ve been walking in the spirit for a long time
- God didn’t intend for me to go through all that hardship, there will be an outpouring of of his grace
- In order to love your neighbor as yourself, I first need to love myself,

  

### feeling heavy from the relationship

Like Dinny said, I feel like this is a time of relaxation on a beach. I recorded on Tuesday that I felt heavy, that I felt like I try to be everything for you. To do right by you.

And in Sunday, after my call with her in the morning I once again felt such a drain and emotional tiredness. I’m always thinking about how to give to her, so much so that I out this heavy burden on me that I wasn’t meant to carry. That I don’t think about how to give to myself and how to relax. I approach it like I do with mom, walk the line of perfection or somethings going to go wrong. I realize I’m stuck in that loop. I really need help to let go of this burden, to be everything, to be perfect, but I don’t know how.

My relationship with Adam, Jess were similar. Walk a fine line actions wise that has nothing to do with who I am as a person. I want to learn how to be on the beach, relaxing.

### distant from god

I also felt a sense of distance from god, because I’ve spent so long with gut issues, I hadn’t had the capacity to seek god in my normal routine. So I started spending at least an hour a day seeking god, and I felt a lot more settled and grounded.

### gut issues

Gut issues finally started to settle down, thank you Jesus. And on Sunday I ate out for the first time in awhile, had banhmi and so far no issues.
