# Proof-of-Work (PoW)
>‚≠ê The quickest solver gets the reward.

### Disadvantages of this
- Favors bigger farms with and/or better hardware
	- Goes against decentralization.
- Very energy intensive.
- Allows mining pools (miners can join forces to calculate and split earnings)
	- Also goes against decentralization.
- Work gets repeated, because you can do the work, and still not be the quickest, in which case your effort is wasted.
