# What is mining?
Mining is the act of securing the blockchain by blocking illegitimate transactions.

## How is trust achieved?
### Proof of Stake
[[Proof-of-Stake (PoS)]] is when a node offers some of their crypto as a *stake*, meaning if were dishonest, the stake would be forfeited.

### Proof of Work
[[Proof-of-Work (PoW)]] is when miners' collateral for dishonesty is computing power. Miners race against each other to make calculations, the first one to finish calculation gets rewarded. If they're dishonest, they waste all the computing power used to calculate the new block, which can be quite a lot.

### Node incentivization
- They receive transaction fees
- They receive a block reward (When a block is newly minted a new set of coins are release). Comes from the *coinbase tranasction*.
