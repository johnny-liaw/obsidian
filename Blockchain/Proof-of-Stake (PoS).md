# Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
> ‚≠ê Minters/forgers offer a security deposit to process transactions, they lose part of the security deposit if the minted block was dishonest.

- Nodes are selected at random to process transactions.
- The more stake a minter offers, the higher the chance they're chosen.
- Stake + transactionn rewards returned after a certain period of time, incase transactions are discovered to be fraudulent.

### Disadvantages
- It favors rich people, because they offer more stake.
- Potentially perpetuating cycle where the rich get richer.

- What if a validator is chosen, but they don't show up to do the job?
- Backup validator pool to choose from.
