> ðŸ’¡ Ethereum computations must be ==deterministic==. The same inputs must always yield the same outputs.

- This reminds me of the [[Functional Programming]] paradigm.

As such ethereum computations must have the following conditions:
- no network requests.
	- The chain should have everything it needs to perform the computation.
	- Gathering data off chain is called using an oracle.
- No randomness
- No asyncness
- No node specific logic (timezone, IP, etc),
