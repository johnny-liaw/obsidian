# What is Elixir?
A [[Functional Programming]] language based on Erlang offering high levels of concurrency and resiliency.

#### Atoms
- Similar to Symbols in JS/Ruby. 
	- Aim to store a reference of a string in memory that cannot be altered. 
	- Great for comparisons.
	- All accesses to the Atom/Symbol are by reference.

#### Supervisor
- Manages the full lifecycle of processes within Elixir.
	- Can restart processes if they die in Elixir.

#### GenServer
- A helper for Elixir to access/mutate state
	- [[GenServer]]
	- [[Application]]
